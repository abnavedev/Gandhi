PART I CLAIMING A NATION (1915–1922) CHAPTER ONE The Returning Hero I On 18 July 1914, Mohandas Gandhi sailed from Cape Town for London. With him were his wife, Kasturba, and his closest friend, a Jewish architect named Hermann Kallenbach. Gandhi was leaving South Africa for good, after two decades spent there in various roles: lawyer, editor, food faddist, activist and prisoner. He had been the unquestioned leader of the small Indian community in South Africa. Now he wished to work with, and for, the several hundred million people of his homeland.  One of the Gandhis’ four children was already in India; the others were on their way, part of a larger group of students from Phoenix, the settlement that Gandhi had established in rural Natal. The patriarch wished to go to London first, because his mentor, the great Poona* educationist and politician Gopal Krishna Gokhale, was there. Ever since they first met in 1896, Gokhale had been the Indian whom Gandhi most admired. In his years in the diaspora he wrote to him regularly, consulting him on matters of politics and social reform. Gokhale, in turn, visited Gandhi in South Africa in 1912, and raised money from wealthy Indians for the causes that Gandhi was fighting for.  Gandhi had first gone to South Africa in May 1893, as a legal adviser to a Gujarati merchant fighting a court case. After the dispute was resolved, he stayed on to build a successful law practice.  Over time, he moved from lawyering to activism, leading campaigns in Natal and the Transvaal against racial laws that bore down heavily on Indians. He went to jail several times; his wife Kasturba too courted arrest. In between campaigns he read and thought deeply on religious matters, practised and advocated the simple life, and ran a weekly newspaper, Indian Opinion (much of which he wrote himself).  Gandhi’s desire to consult Gokhale was born as much out of respect (for the older man) as ignorance (about his own country). At this stage he probably knew South Africa better than he knew India. He was intimately familiar with the peninsula of Kathiawar, where he was born and raised. He had lived briefly in Bombay, and visited Madras, Calcutta and Banaras. But vast areas of the subcontinent were unknown to him. Peasants constituted the majority of Indians; Gandhi had no knowledge of how they lived and laboured.  Gokhale was a leader of the Moderate wing of the Congress party. He believed in debate and dialogue, and in appealing to reason and justice. By these methods he hoped to persuade the colonial government to grant self-rule to his people. At the other end of the spectrum was a group of young Indian revolutionaries, some of whom Gandhi had met (and argued with) in London in 1909. These radicals believed that armed struggle was the only way to win freedom for India.  In South Africa, Gandhi had evolved a method of protest distinct and different both from the polite pleading of the Moderates and the bomb-throwing of the revolutionaries. He called this satyagraha, or truth-force. This involved the deliberate violation of laws deemed to be unjust. Protesting individually or in batches, satyagrahis courted arrest, and courted it again, until the offending law was repealed. In 1909, Gandhi asked the Congress to apply his method to India too. Satyagraha, he said,  ‘is the only weapon suited to the genius of our people and our land’. For ‘the many ills we suffer from in India it is an infallible panacea’. 1 There were other ideas about India that Gandhi developed in South Africa. Himself a Hindu, he worked closely with Muslims. Himself a native Gujarati speaker, in South Africa he came into contact with Indians speaking Tamil, Telugu, Hindi, Urdu and Bengali. He saw that the sustenance of religious and linguistic pluralism was central to the nurturing of nationhood. Living in London and Johannesburg, he became disenchanted with industrialism; he hoped that India would base its economic future on its peasant and craft traditions rather than mindlessly emulate the West.  Though largely unfamiliar with life in India, Gandhi had a reasonably clear idea of what he could contribute to his country. What he was not clear about was where he would base himself, what organizational affiliation he would seek, and what activities he would undertake. That is why he thought it prudent to first visit Gokhale in London. He needed to consult his guru and seek his guidance before embarking on a career in a land where he was, in political and social terms, an outsider.  II Gandhi had first gone to England in 1888, to qualify as a lawyer. He went again in 1906 and 1909, representing to the Imperial Government the case for humane treatment of Indians in South Africa.  This was his fourth visit, but the first time he was travelling in third class. On board, the Gandhis and Kallenbach lived mostly on fruits, nuts and milk. Every day, Gandhi spent an hour reading the Gita or the Ramayana to his wife, and another hour teaching Gujarati to his companion.2 Gandhi and Kallenbach had first met in Johannesburg in 1904. The lawyer and the architect shared a common hero in Leo Tolstoy, under whose influence they abandoned their professions in favour of social work. Kallenbach was devoted to Gandhi, so devoted that the Indians in South Africa called him ‘Hanuman’ (after the monkey god who had served Lord Rama). When the Gandhis decided to return to India, he said he would also come with them. 3 The simplicity that Tolstoy prescribed was harder for Kallenbach than for Gandhi. In Johannesburg he had liked going to the best barbers. He owned one of the first automobiles in the city. Gandhi was able to wean him off these luxuries, but the enchantment with modern technology remained. Now, on board the S.S. Kinfaus, the two argued about a pair of expensive binoculars that the architect owned —and cherished. Kallenbach (out of a mixture of genuine respect and blind reverence) gave way, and the field glasses were flung into the sea. 4 These private arguments were soon overshadowed by the onset of war in Europe. On 28 June— when the Gandhis were still in South Africa—Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb. The S.S. Kinfaus sailed on 18 July towards a Europe still at peace. Ten days into the journey, Austria declared war on Serbia. Russia started mobilizing in defence of the Serbs, prompting the Germans to do the same on behalf of the Austrians.  On 1 August, Germany and Russia were officially at war. Two days later, Germany invaded Belgium.  Now France also stood threatened; on 4 August, Britain declared war on Germany. Underwater mines had been laid in the English Channel; negotiating them carefully, the ship Gandhi was on docked in Southampton on 6 August.  III When Gandhi arrived in London, Gokhale himself was stranded in France. He had gone to Vichy to rest; with the war, ships had temporarily been suspended between Paris and London. So Gokhale asked a friend, the poet Sarojini Naidu—then holidaying in London—to welcome the visitors on his behalf.  The Gandhis were staying with a Gujarati friend in Bayswater. It was raining when Mrs Naidu called on them, climbing (as she later wrote) ‘the staircase of an ordinary London dwelling home to find myself confronted with a true Hindu idyll of radiant and domestic simplicity’. Gandhi, the ‘great South African leader’, was ‘reclining, a little ill and weary, on the floor eating his frugal meals of nuts and fruits (which I shared) and his wife was busy and content as though she were a mere modest housewife absorbed in a hundred details of household service, and not the world-famed heroine of a hundred noble sufferings in a nation’s cause’.  From their first meeting, Mrs Naidu got the sense that ‘Mrs. Gandhi was like a bird with eager outstretched wings longing to annihilate the time and distance that lay before her and her far-off India, and impatient of the brief and necessary interruption in her homeward flight. The woman’s heart within her was full of yearning for the accustomed sounds and scenes of her own land and the mother’s heart within her full of passionate hunger for the beloved faces of her children.’5 Kasturba’s yearning could not yet be realized, for her husband had decided that he must stay on in England to help with the War effort. In 1914, Gandhi was still an Empire loyalist. He believed that the racial laws in South Africa were an aberration, a departure from the equality of all subjects that Queen Victoria had promised. In his struggles against discrimination he had sometimes found support among English officials and politicians. Now that Britain was at war, the Empire’s subjects must— regardless of their race—rally round to defend it. 6 In 1899, Gandhi had raised an ambulance corps during the Anglo-Boer war, and done so again in 1906, when the Natal government suppressed a Zulu rebellion. 7 On both occasions, Gandhi had taken the side of the ruler, without bearing arms himself. Now, for the third time in fifteen years, he would lead his fellow Indians in nursing the wounded.  IV Ten days after landing in London, Gandhi and Kasturba were guests of honour at a reception in Hotel Cecil. Sarojini Naidu was present, as were the nationalist politicians Lala Lajpat Rai and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Gandhi gave a speech, mostly on the South African satyagraha of 1913–14, in which his wife and he, as well as several thousand others, had gone to jail. Praising the courage and sacrifice of the Tamil satyagrahis in Natal, he said: ‘These men and women are the salt of India; on them will be built the Indian nation that is to be.’8 The long sea journey had exhausted Gandhi. He was suffering from pain in his legs. A doctor he saw suspected pleurisy. But he carried on with his work; by the end of August, close to a hundred Indians had signed up for a training class in nursing.  Gandhi’s decision to help in the war effort attracted criticism. Henry Polak, a radical Jew who had been his political lieutenant in South Africa, told him it was a departure from his professions of ahimsa, or non-violence. So did Gandhi’s nephew Maganlal. The novelist Olive Schreiner—a white South African passionately opposed to racism and imperialism—wrote to Gandhi an anguished letter of protest. War, she said, ‘was against my religion—whether it is Englishmen travelling thousands of miles to kill Indians in India, or Indians travelling thousands of miles to kill white men whom they have never seen in Europe’. She was ‘struck to the heart with sorrow’ to read that Gandhi and the ‘beautiful and beloved Indian poetess’ (Sarojini Naidu) had offered to serve the British Government ‘ in any way they might demand of you’. She continued: ‘Surely you, who would not take up arms even in the cause of your own oppressed people cannot be willing to shed blood in this wicked cause.’9 Gandhi’s reply to Olive Schreiner is unrecorded. To his nephew Maganlal, he said that since London owed its food and supplies to the protection of the navy, merely by living there he was participating in the conflict. Attending to the war wounded was his way of repayment for this protection. Otherwise, he wrote, ‘there was only one right course left, which was to go away to live in some mountain or cave in England itself and subsist on whatever food or shelter Nature might provide . . . I do not yet possess the spiritual strength necessary for this.’10 When another Gujarati friend complained that Gandhi’s war work was an abdication of ahimsa, he answered that he was not shooting, merely nursing. He hoped to get a chance to attend to wounded Germans so that he ‘could nurse them without any partisan spirit’. 11 V Gokhale had now returned to London and had long conversations with Gandhi. Each was anxious about the other person’s health. Gandhi worried that his mentor was overweight and did not exercise enough. Gokhale, on his part, thought Gandhi’s pleurisy a consequence of his fruit-and-nut diet.  Gokhale was keen that Gandhi join his Servants of India Society, which focused on education and social reform. Perhaps he could start a chapter of the society in his home province of Gujarat.  However, he advised Gandhi to refrain from public work for a year after his return. He should use this period of ‘probation’ to travel around a country he scarcely knew.12 Gokhale sailed for Bombay on 24 October 1914. The Gandhis would have followed him immediately, except that the British government had refused to grant permission to Kallenbach to accompany them to India, for he was technically a German citizen, and now an ‘enemy alien’. Gandhi made several representations, saying that since he had lived for many years in South Africa, Kallenbach considered himself a naturalized Briton. Influential Englishmen whom Gandhi knew were asked to plead on behalf of Kallenbach. The Colonial Office was unmoved; Gandhi’s ‘German’ friend could not go to India; he was shipped off to an internment camp on the Isle of Man instead.13 The Gandhis had to return home without Kallenbach.  What would Gandhi do on his return to India after two decades in exile? An interesting prediction was offered by C.F. Andrews, an English priest and friend of Gokhale’s who had taught for many years at St Stephen’s College in Delhi. In January 1914, Andrews had worked closely with Gandhi in mediating a settlement with the South African authorities, which abolished a poll tax levied on Indians and also lifted some other restrictions on them. In December of that year, Andrews wrote to Gokhale that I have been thinking a great deal about what Mr. Gandhi will do on his return. Perhaps it is no use thinking as he is bound to take his own course, whatever it may be. He is not one who can be bound. I do feel positive about one thing, that he could not for long [fit] in with the general work of the Servants of India [Society]. He might take up some special sphere, such as work among the depressed classes [i.e. the ‘untouchables’], but he would need to be quite independent. 14 VI The ship carrying Gandhi and Kasturba back home, the S.S. Arabia, landed in Bombay at 9 a.m. on Saturday, 9 January 1915. A large crowd had gathered at the port. When the Gandhis stepped ashore, they were ‘cheered again and again, and the press of people was so great that it was with difficulty that they reached their motor car, and by the time they did so they were almost hidden by garlands’.  Eventually, they got into the car, which drove off, with ‘many of the crowd pursuing it for some distance’.15 Bombay in 1915 had a thriving textile industry, an energetic press (operating in many languages), and many prosperous (and some very philanthropic) merchants. Whereas Calcutta was to a large extent a Bengali city, and Madras a Tamil town, Bombay was a microcosm of the subcontinent, home to migrants from all over India and of all religions and ethnicities.  Bombay was an active centre of politics and of social reform. Gandhi’s work in South Africa had been widely discussed among its intelligentsia. Gokhale had done much to make his protégé better known; as had Henry Polak, who in 1909–10 had spent time in the city, writing and speaking about Gandhi’s struggles.16 Bombay was also home to a large Gujarati community, whose pride in their man was provincial and very intense.  Gandhi and Kasturba stayed at the home of a friend in the northern suburb of Santa Cruz. On 9 January itself, Gandhi met up with Gokhale, and gave an interview to the Times of India. The next day was spent visiting relatives, some of whom had, many years before, opposed his decision to cross the oceans to study law in London. That was in 1888, when he was young and obscure; now, having won fame in a foreign land, he was proudly owned by his caste and community. When Gandhi entered the Gujarati locality of Bazar Gate, he was given a rousing welcome. ‘The windows of chawls were full with people and they were showering flowers. Everyone was equally enthusiastic. The shops of the Parsis were also decorated with flowers.’17 On the morning of 12 January, Gandhi paid his respects to Dadabhai Naoroji, the Parsi veteran whose role in Gandhi’s early career was second only to Gokhale’s. The same evening, a grand party was thrown for the Gandhis at the mansion of the fabulously wealthy Petit family. As a reporter on the spot wrote: ‘Every single sect and community in this cosmopolitan city was represented, and few more influential gatherings have been witnessed in Bombay.’ Among those present were high court judges, European civil servants and the city’s most prominent Parsis, Hindus and Muslims. The main speech was delivered by Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, who praised the returning hero’s courage, selflessness and patriotism. While they were proud of Mr Gandhi, said Sir Pherozeshah, they were prouder of Mrs Gandhi, for ‘standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him in the fight and in the sufferings and privations he was prepared to undergo’ in South Africa. 18 On 13 January, Gandhi attended a gathering hosted by the Bombay National Union, a less westernized group of activists and professionals. Here, Bal Gangadhar Tilak praised Gandhi for having ‘fought for the honour of India in a distant land’. 19 Tilak was the foremost ‘Extremist’ leader of the Congress much as Gokhale was its foremost ‘Moderate’. Both factions had now temporarily united to praise the leader of the struggle in South Africa.  There were more meetings in Bombay, of which two were especially significant. The first was hosted by the Gurjar Sabha, the representative body of the city’s Gujaratis. The proceedings were opened by the young lawyer-novelist K.M. Munshi, who called the gathering ‘a public expression of the feelings of reverence to and admiration for the greatest son of modern Gujarat’. 20 The main speech here was made by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Some aspects of Jinnah’s career resembled Gandhi’s. Born in 1876, like Gandhi he was from Kathiawar; he had likewise studied law in London and sought to build a career at the Bombay Bar. In 1897 he was in correspondence with Gandhi in South Africa. The letters they exchanged are lost—they may have been about a legal partnership the two were hoping to build in Durban. 21 Jinnah eventually stayed on in Bombay, and built a successful practice. He became active in the Congress and simultaneously in the Muslim League (Jinnah was a Shia). An eloquent speaker in English, he was much in demand at public meetings. In 1909, still in his thirties, he was elected to the Imperial Legislative Council, an elite body of policymakers which had only sixty members from across India. 22 Jinnah had spoken several times in support of Gandhi’s struggle in the Transvaal. They were acquaintances rather than friends. Each knew of the other’s reputation. Even so, Jinnah must have had mixed feelings on hearing Gandhi being described as ‘the greatest son of modern Gujarat’. As a member of the Imperial Legislature, he enjoyed an exceptionally high status himself. In terms of proximity to power and authority, Jinnah would, in 1915, probably have counted as the most influential Gujarati alive.  Jinnah’s speech to the Gurjar Sabha was carefully crafted. He praised Gandhi’s ‘strenuous and hard labour’ on behalf of the Indians in the diaspora, and ‘the trials, the sufferings [and] the sacrifices’ he had to undergo on their behalf. But he wondered if Gandhi’s return to India was not ‘a terrible loss to South Africa’. The condition of the community was still precarious, and with Gandhi’s departure, ‘there was nobody who could take his place and fight their battle’.  The caveat stated, Jinnah welcomed the hero home, calling him a ‘worthy ornament’ to the nation-in-the-making. He then drew Gandhi’s attention to the relationship between their respective communities. Hindus and Muslims had been ‘absolutely one, on the South African question’—the ‘first occasion’ on which they had stood so solidly together. The challenge now was to bring ‘that frame of mind’ to Hindu–Muslim relations within India itself. Jinnah asked Gandhi to pay special attention to this central problem: ‘namely, how to bring about unanimity and co-operation between the two communities so that the demands of India may be made absolutely unanimously’. 23 Jinnah had spoken in English. Gandhi made a brief reply, in Gujarati. That a Muslim had been the main speaker in a meeting dominated by Hindus was for Gandhi a happy augury. Now that he was back, he would first ‘study all the Indian questions and then enter upon the service of the country’. 24 The last meeting for the returnees was composed exclusively of women. Its guest of honour was Kasturba Gandhi. A 1000-strong crowd heard speeches in praise of Kasturba by two wives of Parsi knight-millionaires, the widow of the reformer M.G. Ranade, and a representative of the famous Tyabji family. A printed tribute, presented in a silver casket, spoke of Kasturba’s ‘rare qualities of courage, devotion and self-sacrifice [which] had so signally justified and fulfilled the high traditions of Indian womanhood’.  Unlike her husband, Kasturba was unused to public speaking. Her speech was brief but graceful.  She thanked ‘the women of this great and historic city’ for their generosity. She said the honour being accorded to her was really due to the Indian women of South Africa, ‘some of whom had even died in jail’.25 VII After a week in Bombay, the Gandhis proceeded to their native Kathiawar. On 17 January they reached Rajkot, where Gandhi had gone to high school and where the couple had spent their early married years. The reception at Rajkot, wrote one observer, ‘crossed all limits. A pandal was erected at the station. The coaches and engine were decorated with flowers.’ After the Gandhis disembarked from the train, they were taken in a horse-driven carriage through the town, cheered by the large crowd that lined the streets. 26 The Gandhis then proceeded to Porbandar, where both of them were born. Gandhi’s father and grandfather had served as diwans of the state. The residents of Porbandar had closely followed his struggle in South Africa, and raised money for it. Now, streets were decorated with arches, and homes with colourful banners. Schools and colleges were closed for the day. The car carrying the returning couple was preceded by horsemen of the state’s cavalry, and followed by a contingent of the infantry and the military band. Even the ruler came out of his palace to watch the show.  The next day, a crowd in excess of 5000 (including many women) heard a local merchant speak of the simplicity of their home-town hero. The shawl Gandhi was wearing perhaps cost two rupees, he said, but due to wear and tear it was now worth less than two annas. However, since it had been worn by Mohandas Gandhi, he would pay 100 rupees for it. Gandhi handed over the shawl and asked the merchant to donate the money to charity.  After depositing Kasturba in Rajkot, Gandhi proceeded to Ahmedabad, the largest city in the region, and under direct British rule. At a well-attended public meeting, Gandhi thanked Ahmedabad for having provided some of the best satyagrahis for his struggle in South Africa. He wished, if the citizens would accommodate him, to make the city his base in India.27 In the first week of February, Gandhi travelled to Poona to meet Gokhale. His mentor was welcoming, but the other members of the Servants of India Society were discomfited by his presence.  As Gandhi recalled: ‘There was a difference between my ideals and methods of work, and theirs.’ He was unhappy with the dependence of the Servants on servants for their cooking, cleaning and washing; Gandhi, by contrast, preferred to perform these tasks himself.  Gandhi told Gokhale he hoped to settle down in Gujarat, where he would start an ashram on the model of Phoenix, the settlement he had established in South Africa. The older man promised to raise money to support the initiative. As for the Servants of India Society, said Gokhale, ‘whether you are formally admitted as a member or not, I am going to look upon you as one’. 28 Gandhi and Kasturba now travelled across the subcontinent to Bengal. C.F. Andrews had asked him to visit Santiniketan, the rural settlement established by the poet Rabindranath Tagore, who, two years previously, had become the first Asian to win a Nobel Prize. Tagore was not at home when the Gandhis arrived. Gandhi had hoped to stay several weeks in Santiniketan, but news reached him that Gokhale had died in Poona. At a spontaneous memorial meeting in Santiniketan, Gandhi spoke movingly of his mentor. He praised Gokhale’s contributions to politics and social reform, his ‘fearlessness’, ‘zest’, ‘truthfulness’, ‘thoroughness’, and his ‘love and reverence’ for the motherland.  ‘I was in quest of a really truthful hero in India,’ said Gandhi, ‘and I found him in Gokhale.’29 Gandhi retraced his steps westward, reaching his mentor’s home town on 22 February. Arriving in Poona on the same train as Gandhi was the Madras scholar V.S. Srinivasa Sastri, an active member of the Servants of India Society. Sastri and Gandhi were born in the same year, 1869, and both were devoted to Gokhale. There the similarities ended. Sastri was Brahminical in both the good and bad senses of the term: deeply learned in the scriptures, but entirely dependent on the labour of others for his sustenance. As a constitutionalist, he abhorred Gandhi’s use—in South Africa—of strikes, fasts and boycotts to make his case.30 An entry in Sastri’s diary for 27 February reads: At night there was a meeting with Gandhi and a scene.  Spoke up for Society but rather warmly.  Hariji figured well, remarkably so and struck out the phrase ‘moral intoxication’.  H.N. Apte too did well. Poor Gandhi—he sat like a man rebuked. 31 There are no recorded minutes of the meeting. A police report claimed that Gandhi and the society had fallen out because of their ‘different’ and ‘irreconcilable’ ideals. Gandhi, inspired by Tolstoy, wanted to found a rural community ‘where the youth of India will be taught the dignity of manual labour’. The society, on the other hand, wished its members to ‘take part in every movement of modern life, educational, political and economic’. Noting the lack of support for his views, Gandhi withdrew his membership application. 32 C.F. Andrews had warned Gokhale that Gandhi might find the methods of the Servants of India Society confining. So it turned out. Later in 1915, V.S. Srinivasa Sastri succeeded Gokhale as the society’s president.  VIII Gandhi now returned to Santiniketan, to spend a few days with Tagore and Andrews. The residents of Santiniketan had been told beforehand about Gandhi’s capacity for hard physical work. He lived up to this image, telling the students of Tagore’s school that they should dispense with paid cooks and do all the cooking and cleaning themselves. 33 Gandhi’s next stop was Rangoon, where his close friend and patron Pranjivan Mehta was based. A prosperous jeweller, Mehta had been a fellow student with Gandhi in London, had financially supported his work in South Africa, and was the first person to call him ‘Mahatma’.  Pranjivan Mehta had long wanted Gandhi to leave South Africa for India. Mehta believed Gandhi needed a larger theatre for his work; and the motherland needed him. Now, having turned his back on the Servants of India Society, Gandhi wished to consult Mehta about what direction his work might take.34 From Rangoon, Gandhi took a boat to Calcutta before journeying northward to the holy town of Haridwar, on the banks of the Ganga. He arrived at the time of the Kumbh Mela, ostensibly a great show of faith, yet with ‘very little goodness on display’. The akhada s of the sadhus—crowded, unkempt, reeking of marijuana—disappointed him. He was more impressed by the Gurukul Kangri, a school set up by a visionary preacher and friend of C.F. Andrews named Swami Shraddhananda.35 After a week in Haridwar, Gandhi proceeded to Delhi, where he spoke at an institution where Andrews had taught, St Stephen’s College. He refused to offer the students advice on Indian problems, since Gokhale had told him to first spend a year acquainting himself with a country that he, at this time, scarcely knew. Addressing an audience of Hindu and Muslim students in a Christian college, he focused on his mentor’s ecumenism. Gokhale, said Gandhi,  was a Hindu, but of the right type. A Hindu Sannyasi once came to him and made a proposal to push the Hindu political cause in a way which would suppress the Mahommedan and he pressed his proposal with many specious religious reasons. Mr. Gokhale replied to this person in the following words: ‘If to be a Hindu I must do as you wish me to do, please publish it abroad that I am not a Hindu. ’36 From Delhi, Gandhi travelled across the subcontinent to Madras, continuing his education into the habits and mores of his countrymen. In this city he was even more of a hero than in Bombay. A majority of those who went to prison in the South African satyagrahas had been Tamils. Some were women, which is why Kasturba accompanied him on this trip.  When the train carrying the Gandhis reached Madras Central Station, a large crowd was waiting to receive them. They made for the first-class compartment, only to be directed by the guard to the back of the train, where they found their hero, ‘thin and emaciated’ after four days of continuous travel. The Gandhis ‘stepped out of a crowded third class [coach] with no posh travel trunks but bundles of old clothes, like a family of peasants’. With shouts of ‘Long Live Mr and Mrs Gandhi’, the admirers conducted the visitors to a waiting carriage, from which the horses had been unyoked. The coach was pulled through the streets, ‘being cheered all the way’. 37 Gandhi’s host in Madras was G.A. Natesan, editor of Indian Review. Natesan was an early admirer, raising money for Gandhi in South Africa, publishing pamphlets by and about him. Gandhi attended several receptions in his honour, variously organized by Gujarati, Christian and Muslim groups, with one all-embracing ecumenical party hosted by Natesan himself. At a meeting of the local Social Service League, Gandhi gently criticized the orthodoxy of the Madrasi Hindu. He himself approved of Panchama (Untouchable) and high-caste students studying together, insisting that ‘neither the Panchama boys nor the caste boys would be prejudicially affected in any way’.  In late April and early May, Gandhi travelled through the Madras Presidency, visiting the towns and villages from which the indentured labourers in Natal had come. In a speech in Mayavaram, he said it was ‘no part of real Hinduism to have in its hold a mass of people whom I would call “untouchables”. If it was proved to me that this is an essential part of Hinduism, I for one would declare myself an open rebel against Hinduism itself.’38 From the town of Nellore, Gandhi wrote to his friend Albert West, who had helped found the Phoenix settlement, and was now running it more or less on his own. ‘I am going through very varied experiences,’ wrote Gandhi to West. ‘India continues to satisfy my aspirations. I see much to dishearten me and I see much to encourage me.’39 For part of the tour in South India, Gandhi was accompanied by V.S. Srinivasa Sastri. Although they had argued about Gokhale’s legacy, their personal relations remained civil. In Mayavaram, Sastri translated Gandhi’s speeches from English into Tamil. This was noble of him, since his diary entry after the event read: ‘Procession: tedious and annoying.’40 The refined scholar recoiled from the spontaneous (but to him somewhat vulgar) show of affection for Gandhi by the ordinary Tamil.  IX In his first few months in India, Gandhi was continuously on the move. He had no office or secretariat —not even a permanent address. Only a few letters written to him in this period survive. They suggest that he was becoming known across the country. In April he was invited to the third Andhra conference, to be held in Vizagapatnam in the middle of May. The conference was part of a wider movement to create a cohesive state of Telugu speakers, then spread across different provinces and chiefdoms. Its organizers hoped that Gandhi, by blessing the Andhra movement, would endorse the ‘spread of knowledge and culture through the medium of the mother-tongue and the speedy realisation of Indian nationhood by the division of the country into autonomous units on linguistic basis’. 41 In the same week, a letter in Hindi was posted to Gandhi from the Himalayan foothills. ‘Since you are touring India now and have decided to serve the country,’ it said, ‘please improve the conditions of the people in the Himalaya.’ The writer enumerated the problems of hill peasants: the extraction of forced labour by officials, restrictions on access to forests (a vital source of fuel and fodder), no proper schools for their children. ‘Since you are an experienced man,’ the correspondent told Gandhi,  ‘I have related our problems to you. Please come to Naini Tal and Almora, so that I can acquaint you with our difficulties. . . . Do begin the good work from here and carry on till Cape Comorin.’42 Some letters asked for advice, others offered it. A Bombay editor wrote to complain about Gandhi’s strident criticisms of modern life, since despite its many faults, ‘Western civilization, taken as a whole, tends more strongly to justice for all than any older civilization.’ ‘Your career and character is such a vast public asset,’ the editor told Gandhi, ‘that one feels that it is a pity it should be rendered less useful than it might and should be by this prejudice, as I must hold it to be, against modernity as such.’43 Among the letters Gandhi received in the early months of 1915 was one from his son, Harilal.  Unlike previous letters between the two, this was not handwritten, but printed. Harilal had originally intended to release it to the public, but in the end sent it only to family and close friends.  Gandhi and his eldest son had a deeply troubled relationship. Shortly after Harilal was born, in July 1888, his father left to study law in London. Between 1893 and 1896 Gandhi again lived alone, in Durban. The family were reunited for a few years, but then separated again, as Harilal studied in high school in India while his parents and brothers lived in South Africa.  In 1906, Harilal journeyed to South Africa to join the family. He stayed there for four years, in which time he went to jail in the satyagrahas led by Gandhi. He wished to become a barrister like his father. But Gandhi insisted that his eldest son abandon personal ambition and work selflessly for the community. Harilal resisted, and in 1910, now in his early twenties, returned to India to continue his studies. 44 After Gandhi himself returned to India, father and son met, only to fight once more. On 14 March 1915, Gandhi wrote to a nephew: ‘[T]here has been a misunderstanding between Harilal and me. He has parted from me completely. He will receive no monetary help from me.’45 After this quarrel, Harilal composed the long letter that he then had printed. The letter rehearsed their decade of disagreement, the son saying that the father had ‘oppressed’ him, and paid him ‘no attention at all’. ‘Whenever we tried to put across our views on any subject to you,’ said Harilal, ‘you have lost your temper quickly and told us, “You are stupid, you are in a fallen state, you lack comprehension.”’ Harilal also accused Gandhi of bullying Kasturba, writing: ‘It is beyond my capacity to describe the hardships that my mother had to undergo.’ Gandhi had disapproved of Harilal’s marriage, since he fell in love and chose his bride, rather than, as was the custom, have his parents choose a wife for him. Harilal’s relationship with his wife, Chanchi, was intensely romantic; this wasn’t to Gandhi’s liking either, since he believed sex was strictly for procreation and a true satyagrahi should be celibate. Harilal emphatically disagreed. ‘No one can be made an ascetic,’ he told his father. ‘A person becomes an ascetic on his own volition . . .  I cannot believe a salt-free diet, or abstinence from ghee or milk [all of which Gandhi preached and practised] indicates strength of character and morality.’ Harilal claimed he spoke on behalf of his younger brothers as well. Gandhi had imposed his will on his four sons, without ever giving them a hearing. ‘My entire letter stresses one point,’ remarked Harilal. ‘You have never considered our rights and capabilities, you have never seen the person in us.’ The argument stated, at length and with force, Harilal ended on a note of contrition: You know I have not disobeyed you on purpose. It is possible that my views are wrong. I hope that they prove to be wrong—if I realise that they are wrong I shall not hesitate to reform myself. In the deep recesses of my conscience, my only desire is that I be your son—that is, if I am good enough to be your son.46 Harilal’s criticisms were, on the whole, fair. For, Gandhi was the traditional overbearing Hindu patriarch: insensitive to the wishes and desires of his wife; demanding that his children obey his instructions even when they had reached adulthood. Even now, Gandhi failed to reflect on where he might have gone wrong. ‘One will not easily find a parallel to what Harilal has done,’ wrote Gandhi to his nephew Narandas: ‘When a son writes in that manner, there is bound to be bitterness between father and son . . . Harilal has written to say that he has recovered his calm and that he is sorry he wrote that letter. The letter was all error, and I know that, with experience, he will understand things better.’47 X In the second week of May, Gandhi returned to Gujarat, his travels temporarily on hold. He wished to start a community of social workers that would be a model of its kind. He had chosen the city of Ahmedabad as his base. There were several reasons for this. Ahmedabad had prosperous Hindu and Jain merchants who could fund his projects. The language of the city was his mother tongue, Gujarati.  Ahmedabad was located in British India, but—unlike Bombay, Calcutta or Madras—was not greatly influenced by British culture. It had a large Muslim population, allowing him to test his ideas of religious pluralism. And it did not yet have a political leader with an all-India reputation.  Sited on the banks of the Sabarmati River, Ahmedabad was a thriving commercial centre, a major market for gold, cloth and grain. Its Hindu and Jain businessmen were legendary for their acumen.  Some fifty textile mills were established here in the decades before Gandhi arrived, earning the city the moniker, ‘the Manchester of India’.  The population of Ahmedabad in 1915 was about 2,40,000. The bulk of the population still lived within the medieval city walls; slowly, families were shifting out, building residential colonies on the open land across the river. 48 An Ahmedabad businessman who had come forward to back Gandhi was the mill owner Mangaldas Girdhardas. 49 On 11 May, Gandhi submitted to Mangaldas a meticulously detailed description of all that the proposed ashram in Ahmedabad would need. The items listed included the number and size of cooking pots, cups, plates, frying pans, kettles, carpenter’s and cobbler’s tools, agricultural implements, inkstands, blackboards, chamber pots, and maps (of Gujarat, the Bombay Presidency, India and the world). The ashram would have about fifty inmates. Its annual expenditure (excluding land and buildings) would be in the region of Rs 6000.50 Gandhi had hoped to acquire at least ten acres for the ashram. That was not immediately forthcoming, so he rented a building from a local barrister named Jivanlal Desai. This was located in Kochrab, across the river from the main city. Desai’s bungalow was spacious; with a dozen rooms spread across two floors, a lovely tiled roof and a large garden. It would do until a larger plot was identified and purchased.51 On 20 July 1915, Gandhi and a few followers formally took over the building in Kochrab. On the same day, he drafted a constitution for the ashram. Inmates had ‘to learn how to serve the motherland one’s whole life’. They would take personal vows of truth, non-violence, celibacy, non-stealing, non-possession and ‘control of the palate’. They would also commit themselves to the wearing and promotion of hand-spun cloth and the abolition of untouchability. A school for children would also be established, with instruction in the mother tongue.  Gandhi had founded two such settlements in South Africa. One, Phoenix, took the name of a nearby railway station. The second was called Tolstoy Farm, since the land originally belonged to his fellow Tolstoyan, Hermann Kallenbach. Among the names suggested for Gandhi’s first Indian settlement were ‘Sevashram’ (the home of service) and ‘Tapovan’ (the home of austerities). Gandhi eventually decided to call it ‘Satyagraha Ashram’, which, as he noted, conveyed ‘both our goal and our method of service’.  The daily routine of the ashram was similar to that of Phoenix. The inmates woke up at 4 a.m., and bathed. Community prayers (with hymns and texts drawn from Hindu, Christian, Parsi and Muslim traditions) were followed by breakfast. The adults spent the bulk of the day doing manual labour, the children alternating between classes and work. The evening meal was followed by a second round of prayers. The children were to go to bed by 9 p.m., and adults by 10 p.m. 52 Gandhi had circulated the ashram’s constitution to a few friends. One, the Moderate politician Satyananda Bose, wrote a searing critique of the emphasis on brahmacharya, or celibacy. While self-control and self-discipline were important attributes, did one have to enforce them in such a rigorous way? ‘It is not desirable that the country should be peopled by monks and nuns,’ remarked Bose acidly. If the ‘best men’ were ‘called away as celibate Sannyasis’, wrote Bose, ‘the society will consist of mediocres’.53 Gandhi’s reply is unavailable. For him, abstinence from sex was absolutely an article of faith. An early teacher, the Jain preacher Raychandbhai, had termed celibacy ‘that state supreme’, whereby an individual surrendered his desires to ‘tread the path trodden by the wise and the great’. Another major influence, Leo Tolstoy, also embraced celibacy in later life, celebrating it as ‘a man’s liberation from the lusts’. 54 Gandhi’s obsession with celibacy was akin to that of early Christian ascetics in North Africa and the Middle East. For them, writes one historian of the subject, ‘sex typified the kingdom of evil’.  They believed that ‘the supremely dangerous desires inside us are sexual’. In later life, the most famous of these celibates, St Augustine, looked back on the sexual encounters of his youth with ‘horror and disdain’. 55 Like St Augustine, Gandhi gave up sex in his thirties, when fully capable of enjoying its pleasures.  Having once experienced it vigorously, and even fathered four children, he came to view sex with disgust. Gandhi was not a young virgin when he embraced celibacy (as was and often still is the case with many Buddhist, Christian, Jain as well as Hindu monks). Neither was he an old man. Yet Gandhi felt that he had arrived at brahmacharya too late. Now, those who came under his own influence were asked—or mandated—to take the vow as early as possible. 56 XI By early September, the ashram had about thirty members. They included Gandhi’s own family, some Indians from South Africa, and a handful of brave young men who had abandoned their careers in pursuit of an ideal. Recruits were welcome, so long as they were willing to take the vows. The social worker A.V. Thakkar now wrote to Gandhi that ‘a humble and honest untouchable family is desirous of joining your Ashram. Will you accept them?’ This letter, recalled Gandhi in his autobiography, ‘perturbed’ him.57 He had taken a public stance against the practice of untouchability. However, in matters of caste the Hindus of Ahmedabad were cautious and conservative. So soon after he had moved to their city, should he challenge their prejudices in so open a manner?  Varnashramadharma, the rules of caste, strictly forbade members of different castes from living under the same roof or eating at the same table. In July 1915, there were no ‘untouchables’ in the ashram, but there were members from the four main orders: Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya and Sudra.  To justify their cohabitation, the ashram manifesto as drafted by Gandhi said: ‘The Ashram does not follow the varnashram dharma.’ This, he argued, was because the inmates were in the stage of sannyas (renunciation) where such rules did not apply. Then, in a bow to orthodox opinion, Gandhi added: ‘Apart from this, the Ashram has a firm belief in the varnashram dharma. The discipline of caste seems to have done no harm to the country . . . There is no reason to believe that eating in company promotes brotherhood ever so slightly.’58 Shortly after Gandhi reached India, he had received a long letter on the problem of untouchability from a friend in South Africa. The writer, a Tamil Christian named J.M. Lazarus, told Gandhi that in the Madras Presidency, ‘even today, a Pariah dare not walk into a Street inhabited by Brahmins, nor will he even wear his Dhotis below his knees before his Brahmin Lord, nor will he even draw his drinking water from a well used by the Brahmins’.  Comprising some 15 per cent of the Indian population, the ‘untouchables’ were confined to professions such as scavenging and leatherwork, which caste Hindus regarded as ‘unclean’. Though technically Hindus, they were not considered part of the varna system, and not allowed to worship in temples, nor allowed to draw water from the same wells as upper-caste Hindus. In some parts of India even the sight of an ‘untouchable’ was said to ‘pollute’ the Brahmins. The economic degradation and social humiliation that ‘untouchables’ in India experienced had no parallel elsewhere in the world.* Under British rule the situation of the ‘untouchables’ had marginally improved. They could convert to Christianity (as Lazarus had himself done), or abandon their traditional, stigmatized professions to take up jobs in factories and government offices. The growing movement for self-government was no doubt welcome, argued Lazarus, but where did it place the ‘untouchables’? Gandhi’s Tamil friend argued that the Congress was dominated by high-caste men who had ‘not done anything to elevate the oppressed classes’. He worried that if India got political independence, ‘the Brahmins could again pursue their old Steam Roller Policy upon this much neglected and wretched community’.  Lazarus asked Gandhi to pay this ‘great question’ his fullest attention. He understood that ‘by bringing this question forward it may hamper Congress’s aims in some respects and so it behooves us to find some solution of the difficulty’. For, if a solution was not found, ‘the realisation of the ideal of a National India is an utter impossibility’.59 Gandhi himself believed that the practice of untouchability was immoral and unjust. Friends like Lazarus pushed him to make its abolition an active part of his programme. On the other side, he was sensible of the strong feelings of the orthodox Hindu. Gandhi was himself not a Brahmin; born in the Bania, or merchant caste, and without a deep knowledge of Sanskrit, he did not have a formal mandate to prescribe what Hindus should or should not do.  A.V. Thakkar’s letter to him had now placed Gandhi in a quandary. Should he accept the ‘untouchable’ family recommended by Thakkar, or would that imperil the future of the ashram?  Gandhi decided to accept Thakkar’s suggestion. The family consisted of Dudhabhai, his wife, Danibehn, and their baby daughter, Lakshmi. When they arrived at the Satyagraha Ashram on 11 September, there was much grumbling, not least from Gandhi’s own family members. Kasturba was not happy with this decision to defy the orthodox. Danibehn was prevented from drawing water from the common well until Gandhi said in that case he would not use the well either. 60 On 23 September, Gandhi wrote to Srinivasa Sastri about the turmoil caused by the admission of the ‘untouchable’ family. ‘There was quite a flutter in the Ashram,’ he remarked. ‘There is a flutter even in Ahmedabad. I have told Mrs. Gandhi she could leave me and we should part good friends.  The step is momentous because it so links me with the suppressed classes mission that I might have at no distant time to carry out the idea of shifting to some Dhed quarters and sharing their life with the Dheds. ’61 The argument raged within the ashram, and without. Gandhi was able to persuade Kasturba that the step was necessary. However, their principal patron, Mangaldas Girdhardas, decided to withdraw his funding. He was an orthodox Hindu who, after visiting his factory and meeting workers of different castes, would have a purificatory bath before his meal. Gandhi’s decision to admit an ‘untouchable’ family was not something he could abide.  Mangaldas was funding the ashram on a monthly basis. If the next cheque did not come, Gandhi’s experiment, barely three months old, faced extinction. Fortunately, another Ahmedabad industrialist stepped in. In his autobiography, Gandhi does not identify the man, referring to him simply as the ‘Sheth’ (merchant). But we know him to be Ambalal Sarabhai. Twenty-eight years younger than Mangaldas, he was of a more progressive cast of mind, and had travelled widely overseas. 62 Sarabhai and Gandhi had only met once. The businessman had not stepped inside the ashram. But on hearing that the experiment was in trouble, Sarabhai drove to Kochrab and sent word (through one of the schoolchildren) that he wanted to see the founder. Gandhi went outside, where the ‘Sheth’ was waiting in his car. He asked whether Gandhi needed any help. Gandhi replied: ‘Most certainly. And I confess I am at the present moment at the end of my resources.’ Sarabhai told Gandhi that he would come again the following day. Twenty-four hours later, a car horn was heard outside the ashram. Once more, a child was sent to summon Gandhi. From within the car, the ‘Sheth’ handed over a large bundle of currency notes, and drove away.  The notes were worth Rs 13,000, or two years’ expenses. The ashram had been saved, by a benefactor who had not so much as entered the premises.63 But the grumblings continued. Visiting the ashram in October 1915, the district magistrate of Ahmedabad found that ‘the Institution evidently still excites interest. I saw half a dozen students from Bombay, waiting to be shown round, or perhaps to see the great man. But it has come to grief on the matter of caste, and Mr. Gandhi prefers to have things as they are to giving in over what is to him a vital Principle.’64 In the last week of December, Gandhi attended the annual session of the Indian National Congress in Bombay. He moved a resolution deploring the treatment of Indians in South Africa. Later, he heard G.A. Natesan praise him from the podium. ‘The problem of Indian nationality for the solution of which this Congress has been started,’ remarked Natesan, ‘seems to be very satisfactorily solved in South Africa with such brave leaders as Mr. Gandhi.’ Gandhi, said his Tamil admirer, had ‘returned to his motherland after winning a brave feat of arms with weapons unique and almost unparalleled in the history of the world’. 65 Gandhi’s travels in 1915 had exponentially expanded his knowledge of his homeland. He could now apply his mind and his methods to all problems of Indian nationality, whether social, political or religious.  CHAPTER TWO Coming out in Banaras I The year’s probation mandated by Gokhale had ended. Gandhi was now free to speak out on political matters. Although he perhaps did not realize it, he was also freed by Gokhale’s premature death. Had his mentor been alive, Gandhi would have framed his utterances in the light of what Gokhale would make of them. Gokhale may also have tried to keep him within the Servants of India Society, a body that focused on social work and stayed out of political controversies.  Gandhi spent the first month of 1916 in Gujarat. On 1 February, he travelled to Banaras. He had been invited to the founding ceremonies of the Banaras Hindu University, whose prime movers were the theosophist Annie Besant and the Allahabad scholar Madan Mohan Malaviya. A centre of learning and of pilgrimage, Banaras was probably the oldest and certainly the most storied of Indian cities.  The creation of a modern university in an ancient town was originally Mrs Besant’s idea. Malaviya was instrumental in raising the money and in acquiring land for the campus. Among the patrons were some influential (and very rich) maharajas. They would be in attendance at the inaugural ceremony where the chief guest was the viceroy, Lord Hardinge. 1 A massive amphitheatre had been constructed for the opening. The spectators were seated in fifteen different stands, their cards of admission issued in five colours to help them find their place. The band in attendance struck up ‘God Save the King’ as the viceroy came and took his seat. Around him sat sundry maharajas, high officials of the Raj and Indians with knighthoods.  The ceremony began at noon on 4 February, with a speech welcoming the viceroy by a major patron of the university, the maharaja of Darbhanga. The maharaja said they hoped to produce men of intellect and character ‘who love their Motherland, are loyal to the King and are in every way fit to be useful members of the community and worthy citizens of a great Empire’. 2 The viceroy then made a speech of his own, before laying the foundation stone amidst the chanting of Sanskrit hymns. After lunch he was driven off to the railway station on a shining metalled road specially built for the occasion. In his memoirs, the chief guest wrote of how it had been ‘a very big function and a very successful one. . . . The Durbar at Benares was extraordinarily picturesque with the Ruling Chiefs and all the Indians in their smartest clothes, in bright colours and parti-coloured turbans . . . There were 6,000 people present and all very enthusiastic.’3 The viceroy had stayed only for the first day, 4 February. From the 5th to the 8th, the ceremonies carried on, featuring dances, plays, cricket matches and lectures.  Apart from scholars and scientists, some public figures had also been asked to deliver lectures. On the evening of 6 February, Annie Besant spoke on ‘The University as a Builder of Character’.  Immediately after her, Gandhi was due to speak. The title of his talk was not listed on the programme; but it was assumed that he would speak about his experiences in South Africa.  Gandhi’s autobiography does not mention this visit to Banaras. Whether the omission was deliberate one cannot say. (The book was written as a series of newspaper articles, and in any case, memoirists have the freedom to include or exclude memories as they please.) Nonetheless the omission is striking. For, Gandhi’s speech in Banaras was the first properly public statement he made after his return to the homeland. What he said created a stir; how the audience responded to what he said created a stir too.  The text of Gandhi’s Banaras speech in the Collected Works is taken from an anthology of his writings published by G.A. Natesan in 1918. In sending his text to Natesan, Gandhi said he had ‘merely removed some of the verbiage which in cold print would make the speech bad reading’. The provincial archives in Lucknow contain the unexpurgated version, this based on the notes in shorthand of a reporter from the Leader newspaper.4 Among the sections excised by Gandhi was a broadside against Lord Macaulay. In making English the language of instruction in India, Macaulay had hoped ‘to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern . . . a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect’. 5 Gandhi commented acidly that ‘Lord Macaulay made many blunders in his life, all unconsciously, but so far as India is concerned there was never a greater blunder made than when he penned that minute on education’.  Also excised by Gandhi was a paragraph suggesting that the new university was in danger of isolating itself from the masses. The salvation of the country, he had remarked, ‘is only going to come when the agriculturist, when the artisan of India is educated up to his sense of responsibility, when he finds that he has at least enough to feed himself on, to clothe himself. And you are not going to learn all these things in the university . . .’ For all that it left out, the text that Gandhi sent to the printer was powerful and provocative enough.  One section directly attacked the princes who were the new university’s main patrons. Was it necessary, asked Gandhi, ‘that in order to show the truest loyalty to our King-Emperor, it is necessary for us to ransack our jewellery-boxes and to appear bedecked from head to toe’? Gandhi told the invitees that ‘there is no salvation for India unless you strip yourself of this jewellery and hold it in trust for your countrymen in India (“Hear, hear” and applause)’. ‘There can be no spirit of self-government about us,’ he went on, ‘if we take away or allow others to take away from the peasants almost the whole of the results of their labour.’ The previous day, Gandhi had visited the city’s most famous shrine, the Kashi Vishwanath temple.  He found it filthy, the state of the temple symptomatic of the state of Indian society. As he told his audience in the university, ‘If a stranger dropped from above on to this great temple and he had to consider what we as Hindus were, would he not be justified in condemning us? Is not this great temple a reflection of our own character? . . . Is it right that the lanes of our sacred temple should be as dirty as they are? . . . If even our temples are not models of roominess and cleanliness, what can our self-government be?’ Hearing Gandhi’s strictures against princely excess and Hindu custom were the princes themselves.  One, the maharaja of Alwar, left the podium in protest. As he walked out, he passed the commissioner of Banaras, and said, ‘I am simply disgusted, the man must be mad.’ The commissioner replied, ‘Well Maharaja Sahib, this is no place for us.’6 Gandhi carried on, asking why, when the viceroy came to Banaras, there were so many detectives on the streets and on rooftops. Was this a sign of fear? He then spoke of the anarchists of Bengal, who sought to throw bombs at high officials in the hope that they would be terrorized into fleeing India.  Gandhi termed their zeal ‘misdirected, and wondered why they were so afraid to come into the open’.  At this stage, Annie Besant, sitting behind Gandhi, intervened, saying: ‘Stop! Please Stop!’ More princes began leaving the stage. The students in the audience, on the other hand, shouted: ‘Go On! Go On!’ Gandhi asked the chairman (the maharaja of Darbhanga) what he should do. The chairman answered: ‘Please explain your object.’ Gandhi then said that ‘there is no room for anarchism in India’. He himself wished ‘to purge India of the atmosphere of suspicion on either side’ so as to create an empire ‘based on mutual love and mutual trust’.  The caveat entered, Gandhi returned to the polemical mode. He deplored ‘the atmosphere of sycophancy and falsity’ that surrounded the high officials of the Raj. He characterized their behaviour as ‘overbearing’ and ‘tyrannical’. He then said that Indians would never be granted self-government; they had to take it for themselves, as the Boers had done in South Africa. The suggestion of a rebellion against the Raj led to more agitation on the stage. Mrs Besant asked Gandhi once more to stop; the chairman, an arch-loyalist like the rest of his ilk, declared the meeting closed.  As the princes left the podium, Madan Mohan Malaviya walked over and addressed the crowd. He was sorry that Gandhi’s speech had ‘given offence in high quarters’. The references to anarchists had alarmed the chiefs; had they waited, they would have come to know that Gandhi was in fact deploring their methods. What Gandhi wanted to do, said Malaviya, was ‘to wean from all time our students from the evil influences of those who themselves hiding behind the screen, turn young men into the wrong part’.7 A member of the audience later recalled that ‘everybody was offended’ by Gandhi’s speech: ‘the Ruling Princes because of his ungenerous attack on their jewellery, the University authorities because of the slight cast on them by his riling at their princely patrons, the C.I.D. officers because of his appreciation of sedition mongers, and lastly Mr. Gandhi himself, because the meeting terminated abruptly without even a “by your leave” to the speaker.’8 II The day after his speech, Gandhi wrote a letter to the maharaja of Darbhanga, clarifying that he held ‘very strong views against all acts of violence and anarchy’. His mission was ‘securing the utmost freedom for my country but never by violence’. The maharaja was unpersuaded. On 7 February, when presiding over another public lecture, the maharaja of Darbhanga said that ‘they had heard with grief and pain the remarks of Mr. Gandhi [the previous day] and he was sure they all disapproved the attitude Mr. Gandhi had taken up’. 9 Gandhi had, meanwhile, left Banaras for Bombay. On 9 February, a correspondent from the Associated Press asked why his speech had become so controversial. Gandhi clarified that while he thought the anarchists had ‘patriotic motives’, their methods did great damage in the long run. He had never endorsed violence; indeed, it was his ‘firm belief that, but for Mrs. Besant’s hasty and ill-conceived interruption, nothing would have happened and my speech in its completed state would have left no room for any doubt as to its meaning’. 10 When a report of this interview reached Mrs Besant, she hastened to defend herself. She had, she said, heard a police officer sitting behind her say, ‘Everything he says is being taken down, and will be sent to the Commissioner.’ Since Gandhi’s remarks were ‘capable of a construction’ contrary to what he intended, she had told the chairman that ‘politics is out of place in that meeting’. ‘If the meeting had been called by Mr. Gandhi,’ said Mrs Besant, ‘it would have been no one’s business but his own what he chose to say.’ But as a member of the university committee, she was responsible to the invitees, to whom Gandhi’s remarks did seem a provocation. 11 Mrs Besant was correct on one count; the government was keenly following what Gandhi had to say. The superintendent of police in Banaras wired his bosses in Lucknow about the visitor’s ‘objectionable speech’. The copy of the speech prepared by the Leader was obtained; and the newspaper was prohibited from publishing it. In a long report on the incident, the commissioner of Banaras grimly noted that ‘the reception by the students of Gandhi’s address indicated the spirit which permeates them. The remarks which they cheered were those which referred to the giving up of English, and the turning of the English—bag and baggage—out of the country.’12 The authorities were confused as to how to deal with the provocation. The police and the legal remembrancer to the United Provinces (UP) government both held Gandhi’s remarks to be ‘seditious and disloyal’, and recommended that he be arrested and prosecuted under the Indian Penal Code. The chief secretary disagreed; Gandhi, he noted, ‘is already a popular hero, and prosecution will only madden him still further and increase his influence with the students. Cold water seems better than the martyr’s stake.’13 These notes and opinions went back and forth between the different departments of the UP government. On 17 March—a full five weeks after the speech—the lieutenant governor, James Meston, summed up the debate in magisterial terms: My own impression is that Gandhi started with the intention of talking against the use of violence in the nationalist campaign and the importance of cultivating higher qualities than brute force. . . . But however well designed the outlines of his address might have been, Gandhi clearly got carried away by his own rhetoric and by the applause with which the students received some unguarded expressions which he used. In his growing excitement, he lost control of himself, and let out his real sentiments. Part of his speech was admirable; part was in thoroughly bad taste; the rest, though not a deliberate or intentional incitement to sedition, was in effect seditious and open to grave objection.  The lieutenant governor also advised against prosecution, since ‘influential men in his own community’ had distanced themselves from Gandhi’s views, and since action against him would spoil the success of the university’s inauguration as a whole. The ‘wisest course’ therefore, would be for the government to let the matter drop, and allow the incident caused by Gandhi’s speech to ‘slip into obscurity and oblivion’.14 III Although Gandhi disassociated himself from the methods of the anarchists, his suggestion that their motives were patriotic caused disquiet. No group of Indians was more loyal to the Empire than the maharajas. And Madan Mohan Malaviya himself belonged to the ‘Moderate’ wing of the Congress party, which believed in slow, incremental gains for Indians granted by Britons from above.  The princes and the Moderates both had a horror of violent protest. That the viceroy had inaugurated the university was further evidence that this was an establishment affair. Gandhi’s mere mention of terror and assassination muddied the waters. Lord Hardinge had himself narrowly escaped an attempt on his life in December 1912, when a bomb had been thrown at him while he was on an elephant in a grand public procession in Delhi.15 The detectives who shadowed the viceroy as he drove through the streets of Banaras were there to forestall a second attack.  The official commentary on Gandhi’s speech focused on whether the references to anarchism were ‘seditious’. But in fact, the speech was—and is—notable for far more than its treatment of violence and non-violence. In Banaras, Gandhi made four fundamental claims about how Indians should conduct their affairs.  First, Gandhi argued in favour of instruction in the mother tongue. English, the foreign language imposed on India, should have no place in education or public affairs;  Second, Gandhi pointed to the sharp inequalities between different groups in India. He contrasted the luxuriant lifestyles of the maharajas with the desperate poverty of the majority of Indians. That is why he asked the princes to cast off their jewels, and told the students that they must acquaint themselves with the living conditions of peasants, artisans and labourers; Third, he asked that officials of the state identify more closely with those they governed over. He deplored the arrogance of the elite Indian Civil Service (ICS), whose officers saw themselves as members of a ruling caste rather than as servants of the people;  Finally, Gandhi asked for a more critical attitude towards religious orthodoxy. The Kashi Vishwanath was the most famous temple in all of Banaras. Why then was it so filthy? If Indians were incapable of maintaining even their places of worship, how then could they justify their claims for self-rule?  Gandhi’s speech was an act of courage. In February 1916, he was altogether without any influence or power in British India. And yet, he made direct and telling criticisms of wealthy princes, important officials and the guardians of religious orthodoxy. In India’s holiest city, at a function inaugurated by the viceroy and patronized by his leading collaborators, a lawyer lately returned from many years abroad had served notice of his intention to transform his faith and his country.  IV In the third week of February 1916, Gandhi travelled to Poona to mark the first anniversary of Gokhale’s death. Addressing a 2000-strong audience at the Kirloskar Theatre, Gandhi spoke of how he had found ‘that the country was vibrating with a passionate spirit of patriotism, but the bugbear of “fear” loomed large on the horizon. . . . The spiritual liberty of the people was usurped by the priests; in politics they were afraid to give expression to their views.’16 From Poona, Gandhi travelled north-west to Sindh. He spent several days in the port city of Karachi, where there was a large community of Gujarati traders. In a speech in the inland town of Hyderabad, he said ‘swaraj and swadeshi must go together’. Political freedom, or swaraj, was being coupled with economic self-reliance, or swadeshi. 17 In July, Gandhi published a pamphlet in Gujarati on the problems of railway passengers. This was based on his own extensive travels over the past year and a half. He told stationmasters that by ‘using courtesy in your dealings with poor passengers you can set an example to your subordinates’.  Booking clerks were asked to issue tickets promptly, and policemen not to accept bribes. As for his fellow passengers, Gandhi urged them not to rush to board the train or carry excessive luggage, not to smoke if others in the coach objected, and to use lavatories with care. Finally, they were asked to disregard differences of caste and language while they travelled: ‘If you think of all [passengers] as children of India who have for the nonce assembled under one roof, and cherish a brotherly feeling for all, you will be happy this very moment and bring glory to India.’18 Some months later, Gandhi published, in both Gujarati and Marathi, a long essay on the caste system. This fourfold division of Hindu society had, he argued, ‘struck such deep roots in India that I think it will be far more advisable to try to improve it, rather than uproot it’. He thought that prohibitions on different castes intermarrying and eating together were conducive to self-control.  ‘With an arrangement of this kind, there is a good chance that loose conduct will be kept down.’ At the same time, he said, the system should allow exceptions so that ‘if I eat in the company of a Bhangi [from the “untouchable” sweeper caste] there being, from my point of view, greater self-control in doing so, the community should have nothing to do with the matter’. 19 While condemning untouchability outright, Gandhi was not prepared to criticize the caste system itself. He thought that by restricting oneself to a bride of one’s own caste, the predatory instincts of young men would be checked. But, for those who had already achieved a greater degree of ‘self-control’ (such as himself), mixing and mingling with other castes was permissible. The system, he seemed to be saying, would not be brought down; but heretics should not be persecuted either.  V From June to November 1916, Gandhi was mostly in Ahmedabad, where he was building a cadre of devoted co-workers. A young lecturer of English named Valji Govind Desai resigned his job and joined Gandhi. So did a precocious scholar named Vinoba Bhave, who had studied Sanskrit in Banaras, where he had attended and been moved by Gandhi’s famous/notorious talk at the university’s inauguration. This new recruit practised an extreme physical austerity. ‘Your son,’ wrote Gandhi admiringly to Bhave’s father, ‘has acquired at so tender an age such high-spiritedness and asceticism as took me years of patient labour to do.’20 Gandhi was also garnering devotees elsewhere in India. An idealistic merchant named Jamnalal Bajaj—based in Wardha in the Central Provinces—visited the ashram several times and started funding it. Also keenly following Gandhi’s work was C. Rajagopalachari, a young lawyer based in Salem. In February 1916, Rajagopalachari wrote a long essay outlining, for a southern audience, Gandhi’s ‘Message to India’, namely an emphasis on Hindu–Muslim harmony, non-violence, and the promotion of handicrafts to foster self-reliance.21 In late October, a conference of political workers in the Bombay Presidency was held in Ahmedabad. M.A. Jinnah was elected president of the conference, his name proposed by Gandhi, who described him as a ‘learned Muslim gentleman’, ‘a person who holds [a] respected position in the eyes of both parties’. Gandhi went on to say that ‘the feeling we should outwardly show, that moderates or extremists, Surtis or Kathiawaris or Ahmedabadis, Hindus or Muslims, all are our brethren, should be there in our hearts’.22 In November, his South African comrade Henry Polak came visiting. To their mutual friend Hermann Kallenbach, Polak wrote that ‘G. looks better than I have seen him looking in years.  Evidently India, with its many disappointments, has offered him a more congenial atmosphere. Mrs G., too, looks much better and fuller than I have seen her for a long time.’23 VI In 1916, as Gandhi was clearing a space for himself, two more famous names in Indian politics founded ‘Home Rule Leagues’. Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Annie Besant were both enormously charismatic individuals. Tilak was a fiery orator who had recently served a long jail term on charges of ‘sedition’. He was popular in western India, especially in his native Maharashtra, where he had promoted a cult of the medieval warrior-king Shivaji. Besant’s appeal was more to the English-speaking middle classes, who were flattered by this Western woman’s romance with Hinduism, and genuinely admired her work on education.  Tilak started his Home Rule League in April 1916; Besant started hers in September of the same year. Both experiments were inspired by the struggle for independence in Ireland. They aimed at nudging—or pushing—the British rulers towards granting self-government to Indians.24 Tilak and Besant both had their eye on the annual meeting of the Congress, held that year at the same time, and in the same town, Lucknow, as the annual meeting of the Muslim League. This was by choice; through 1916, the two organizations had tried to establish a working relationship. In recent times, Muslims had stayed away from the Congress, weakening its credibility. Now an attempt was being made to heal the breach. The prime movers were Tilak, from the side of the Congress, and Jinnah, on behalf of the League. The two men were friends; Jinnah had even served as Tilak’s lawyer in a case brought against him by the government.  The last time Tilak had attended a Congress meeting was at Surat in 1907, when the party split into Extremist and Moderate factions. Now the factions had come together on the same platform once more. For his journey to the Lucknow Congress in December, Tilak had arranged for a special train to carry his supporters. As the ‘Home Rule Special’ pulled into Lucknow station, it was met by a large crowd, ‘showering roses on [Tilak] and offering countless bouquets and garlands’. Tilak was conveyed through the city’s streets in an open carriage drawn by young men shouting the slogan he had made famous: ‘Swaraj is my birthright and I shall have it.’25 If Tilak was the star of the Congress, the leading light of the Muslim League was Jinnah. He had been elected president for the session. The League was dominated by large landlords and nawabs who were abjectly loyal to the British. Jinnah, however, recognized the growing force of nationalist sentiment, and his election signalled a shift in the League’s orientation.  Leading up to the meeting, Jinnah had appealed to his ‘Hindu friends to be generous and liberal and welcome and encourage other activities of Muslims even if it involves some sacrifice in the matter of separate electorates’. Back in 1909, the British had granted separate electorates to Muslims on the grounds that otherwise they would be swamped by the Hindus. The move was bitterly opposed by the Congress. Jinnah now offered a quid pro quo: in exchange for the retention of this special provision, the Muslim League would join hands with the Congress in demanding self-government for India. 26 In Lucknow, the Congress and the Muslim League committed themselves to a common programme.  Through this ‘Lucknow Pact’, they jointly demanded that ‘India should be lifted from the position of a dependency to that of an equal partner in the Empire’. The Congress and the League asked for four-fifths of the central and provincial legislatures to be composed of elected (rather than nominated) members, and for provinces to have autonomy in designing their laws and running their administrations; for, in sum, India to be placed on par with self-governing dominions such as Australia and Canada.27 Attending the Congress and League meetings in Lucknow was a brilliant and beautiful girl named Ruttie Petit. Her father, a massively wealthy Bombay Parsi, was a long-time client of Jinnah’s. In the summer of 1916, Jinnah had taken a holiday at the Petits’ bungalow in the hill station of Darjeeling.  He and Ruttie had taken walks and rides together; and had fallen in love. It was, for the times, an unorthodox, controversial romance, for the courting couple were of different religions, and also many years apart in age. 28 Ruttie came to Lucknow with her parents, attending the Congress sessions with keen interest. Later, she wrote to a friend about how Lucknow, ‘the City of Mosques’, had welcomed the worshippers of the Lords Krishna and Buddha. It has heard the carefully measured words of the Moderates and also the reckless indictments of the Extremists against an alien Government. It has thrilled to the passionate appeal of the Nationalists who have sacrificed all at the feet of the Motherland. 29 Like Ruttie Petit, Mohandas Gandhi was in attendance in Lucknow during that week of political meetings. He played a modest part in the proceedings; chairing a session of the Congress devoted to a common language policy, and addressing the Muslim League about the conditions of Indians in South Africa. In between, he loaned his blanket to Srinivasa Sastri—late December was icily cold in North India, and the scholarly Madrasi needed protection more—much more—than the ascetic Gujarati.30 CHAPTER THREE Three Experiments in Satyagraha I One of the resolutions passed at the Lucknow Congress related to the conditions of peasants in Bihar’s indigo plantations. Speaking on the resolution, a peasant from Champaran named Raj Kumar Shukla said the European planters ‘have become so powerful that they decide civil and criminal cases themselves and punish the poor ryots [peasants] as they choose’. Shukla continued: ‘I do not know what I shall have to suffer when I go back to Champaran for my coming here and relating the story to you all.’1 Shukla had spent much of the past decade mobilizing the peasants of Champaran against the forcible exaction of indigo. He and another peasant activist named Shaikh Gulab sent petitions to the collector, and organized peaceful marches, and even a strike, which ended with the striking peasants being beaten up by the planters and the police.  Shukla was at the 1916 Congress, where he spoke to Bal Gangadhar Tilak about the indigo question; but Tilak was not inclined to take it up, seeing it as a diversion from the larger struggle for independence from British rule. Then Shukla approached Gandhi, and seizing Gandhi’s legs, said (in Hindi): ‘Please come to Champaran and save us peasants from the exactions of the indigo planters!’2 Gandhi refused, politely, and proceeded from Lucknow to his next stop, Kanpur. Shukla followed him there: ‘Champaran is very near here. Please give a day,’ he pleaded. Gandhi now said—perhaps out of courtesy rather than intention—that he would come when he was free.  Gandhi returned to his ashram at Ahmedabad, to find ‘the ubiquitous Rajkumar was there too’. He demanded that a date be fixed for the promised visit. Gandhi, forced to commit himself, said he would be in Calcutta in April, and could come to Bihar then. 3 Why did Shukla seek out Gandhi? Tilak and Malaviya had rebuffed him; perhaps, as a second-rung Congress leader, Gandhi was more likely to find the time to visit a remote rural district. Shukla also knew that there were plantation workers from Bihar in South Africa, some of whom had been Gandhi’s clients.  Once Shukla had settled on Gandhi as the leader he wanted, he was remarkably persistent. After he returned to Champaran, he wrote to Gandhi that ‘nineteen lakh oppressed subjects of Champaran are awaiting eagerly to have a “darsan” of your lotus feet and they have not hope but full belief that they shall be emancipated as soon as your honour will set foot in Champaran . . .’4 Notably, Raj Kumar Shukla was not the only person from Champaran seeking Gandhi’s intervention. Equally active in this regard was Pir Muhammad Munis, a correspondent with Pratap, the Hindi daily edited from Kanpur by the nationalist Ganesh Shankar Vidyarthi. Munis wrote often of the travails of the indigo farmers, and hoped that Gandhi, with his experience in South Africa, would come and fight for them.5 II Indigo had been cultivated in the subcontinent since ancient times. In the late eighteenth century, the East India Company seized on indigo as likely to command a market in Europe. Settlers came to Bengal and Bihar, establishing plantations to make the highly prized dye that the crop produced.  The British planters in eastern India were sons of lawyers, clergymen and army officers. While distinctly lower in status than men of the Indian Civil Service, they often enjoyed a higher standard of living. In addition to his salary, the manager of an indigo plantation got a share of the factory’s profits.  He was provided oil and other fuel free, and sometimes grain and vegetables too. The countryside teemed with wildlife, with leopards and tigers to be had for trophies, and deer and partridges for the pot.  In the second half of the nineteenth century, close to 1,00,000 acres of indigo were cultivated in Champaran alone. In 1897, synthetic indigo was invented in Germany. This led to a steep fall in the price of natural indigo, and soon, a fall in production as well. In 1896, there were 112 plantations in Bihar producing an average of 2.6 million kilograms each. By 1914, there were only fifty-nine plantations producing a mere 3,00,000 kilograms apiece.  The First World War, and the stoppage of trade with Germany, renewed the demand for indigo from Bihar. Its price tripled; and production began to expand once more. Keen to take advantage of the shortfall, the planters began to press hard on the peasantry. The acreage under indigo, which had reduced to 8100 acres in 1914, had expanded to 21,900 acres two years later.  Indigo was cultivated both on land owned by factories and by peasants on their own plots. Under a harsh colonial law (known as tinkathia), peasants were obliged to put a proportion of their land (once 3/20, then 1/10) under indigo, or else pay an enhanced rent (known as sharabeshi) to the factory. Those who refused to meet this obligation had their land confiscated. Peasants had long been unhappy with the demand to grow indigo. They wanted the freedom to grow the crops they wished.  The European planters were resented for their brash, often brutal, manner. Using their influence with the state, the planters appropriated communal pastures and cultivated indigo on them. 6 From the early twentieth century the peasants protested their condition, sending petitions to the government and holding meetings. In 1907–08, some villages took a collective vow not to grow indigo. Raj Kumar Shukla joined the movement. In 1914, Shukla was briefly sent to jail for quarrelling with a European manager. Two years later, he took the issue to the Lucknow Congress, after which he persuaded Gandhi to visit Champaran. 7 III Gandhi reached Muzaffarpur, north Bihar’s largest town, on 11 April 1917. The next morning he wrote to the commissioner saying he had come to study the indigo plantations, with, he hoped, ‘the cognizance and even co-operation . . . of the local administration’.  In Muzaffarpur, Gandhi’s host was a lanky scholar from Sindh named J.B. Kripalani. The two had first met in Santiniketan in 1915. Now Kripalani was teaching history at a local college. He received Gandhi at Muzaffarpur station and brought him home in a carriage hauled by enthusiastic students. The boys wanted the visitor to be honoured in the traditional manner, with an aarti. This ritual required a couple of coconuts, which the agile Kripalani, rather than the students, obtained from a tree in the college compound. 8 On 13 April, Gandhi called on the commissioner, L.F. Morshead. After their meeting, Morshead wrote to the district magistrate (DM) of Champaran warning him that Gandhi was coming his way.  Since (in the commissioner’s view) ‘his object is probably agitation rather than a genuine search for knowledge’, and ‘there is a danger of disturbance to the public tranquility should he visit your district’, the DM was advised to deport Gandhi from Champaran under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. 9 The same day, Gandhi wrote to his nephew Maganlal that ‘the situation here is more serious than I had imagined. It [the treatment of indentured labourers] seems to be worse than in Fiji and Natal.’ Then he added: ‘I have seen the authorities. They may be thinking of apprehending me.’10 Gandhi arrived in the district town of Motihari on 15 April. The next morning he set out for a village named Jasaulipatti, where tenants complained about oppression by the planters. The most convenient mode of transport was an elephant. It was a hot day, and Gandhi had never sat on an elephant before. Swaying from side to side, he engaged his companions on the purdah system then widely prevalent in North India. When they defended the purdah, Gandhi called it ‘pernicious’, for it damaged the wife’s health and did not allow her to work alongside her husband.  The conversation was interrupted by a man on a bicycle, who shouted out to Gandhi that the district magistrate wished to meet him. The messenger identified himself as a police subinspector. Gandhi dismounted, and said he was expecting this. Asking his companions to proceed to Jasaulipatti, he made his way back to Motihari (using a bullock cart procured by the policeman). 11 In the town, Gandhi was served a notice by the DM, telling him to leave the district ‘by the next available train’. Gandhi replied that he would stay, since he had come ‘purely and simply for a genuine search for knowledge’.12 Meanwhile, he wrote to the viceroy that ‘the ryots are living under a reign of terror and their property, their persons, and their minds are all under the planters’ heels’. 13 While this was Gandhi’s first encounter with the sufferings of peasants in India, in South Africa he had fought for the rights of plantation workers. His knowledge of the British legal system and his prior experience with agrarian oppression made the situation in Champaran a perfect test case for him.  Since Gandhi had declined to leave the district, he was served with a notice to appear before a magistrate on the afternoon of 18 April. His mood was buoyant. To his old comrade Henry Polak (who was then touring India), he wrote: ‘I am recalling the best days of South Africa. . . . The people are rendering all assistance. We shall soon find out Naidoos and Sorabjis and Imams. I don’t know that we shall stumble upon a Cachalia’ (these being his closest associates in South Africa).14 Gandhi spent the morning of 18 April taking testimonies from indigo cultivators. Shortly after noon he went to the court, where a large and excited crowd had collected. Gandhi was asked to sit in the court’s library while the police secured the building from intrusion.  At the hearing, Gandhi said he had come to Champaran to render ‘humanitarian and national service’. The ryots had invited him to see how they were ‘not being fairly treated by the planters’.  While he had no intention of disturbing the peace, as ‘a self-respecting man’ he was bound to disobey the DM’s order and stay on in the district. 15 Gandhi agreed to the DM’s request to stay in Motihari town and not venture further into the villages. On 20 April, the chief secretary tersely informed the commissioner that he ‘did not go about the matter in the right way’. Gandhi had said he would work with the local authorities; why wasn’t he taken at his word? The lieutenant governor, advised of the situation, advised that the legal proceedings against Gandhi be abandoned. 16 Gandhi was now free to make his inquiries. He based himself alternately in Champaran’s two main towns, Motihari and Bettiah. Some days he ventured into the villages himself. He met many peasants, and also spoke to European planters and factory managers. Everywhere, he was followed by policemen in civilian clothing, who took notes of what he said at his meetings.  A group of lawyers had arrived from Patna to assist Gandhi. They included Brajkishore Prasad, whose interest in Champaran was of long standing, and Rajendra Prasad, a scholar educated in Calcutta and a rising star at the Bar. They travelled from Patna on 18 April, with Henry Polak, who filled the hours on the train by recounting tales of Gandhi’s ‘doings in South Africa’. The next day, Gandhi’s other great English friend, C.F. Andrews, also arrived in Motihari to check on his new campaign. 17 The Patna lawyers had brought their own servants to cook their meals. These men ate well and they ate late, with nashta (snacks, frequently fried) at dusk, and a full dinner at 11 p.m. Gandhi persuaded the lawyers to dispense with their servants and help with the cooking, and to eat earlier and more frugally too. Seeing Gandhi wash his own clothes, they were forced to follow suit. 18 The coming of these educated Indians enraged the Europeans of the district. The secretary of the Bihar Planters Association wrote angrily to the commissioner that ‘whatever Mr. Gandhi’s real aims may be, there is unfortunately no question as to the objects of the band of disloyal and seditious agitators who are in his train’.19 The local branch of the European Defence Association passed a resolution stating that the presence of Gandhi in the district ‘has been accompanied by unrest and crime’, and that ‘his continued presence is likely to be disastrous to the welfare of the Europeans in Champaran and the welfare of the district’.20 Two weeks after Gandhi’s arrival, the subdivisional magistrate of Bettiah, W.H. Lewis, observed that ‘by the planters Mr. Gandhi is very naturally regarded as their natural enemy’. But while Europeans may ‘look upon Mr. Gandhi as an idealist, a fanatic or a revolutionary according to our particular opinions’, to ‘the raiyats he is their liberator, and they credit him with extraordinary powers. He moves about in the villages, asking them to lay their grievances before him, and he is daily transfiguring the imagination of masses of ignorant men with visions of an early millennium.’21 IV By the end of May, Gandhi had collected almost 7000 testimonies. In early June he travelled to Bihar’s summer capital, Ranchi, to place them before the lieutenant governor of the state. The evidence was overwhelming. On 10 June, a Champaran Agrarian Enquiry Committee was appointed by the Bihar government. Gandhi was a member, as were four British officers of the Indian Civil Service. The chairman was an official from the Central Provinces.  Gandhi had now decided to open some schools in Champaran. A range of volunteers came to assist him. Kasturba Gandhi also arrived to join her husband. Her presence attracted the attention of a planter named W.S. Irwin, whose dislike for Gandhi was intense even by the standards of his class.  Irwin wrote an angry letter to the Statesman, saying that while Gandhi had promised the commissioner that he would not indulge in public activities, he had been giving contentious speeches on cow slaughter and Hindu–Muslim relations. Meanwhile, claimed Irwin,  During the absences of her lord and master at Home Rule and such-like functions Mrs. Gandhi . . . scatters similar advice broadcast, and has recently, under the shallow pretence of opening a school, started a bazaar in the dehat . . . This is obviously and palpably done to shut down and ruin two neighbouring bazaars belonging to the factory. Can all this above be palpably construed into an honest fulfilment of Mr. Gandhi’s undertaking to Government? 22 Gandhi at once wrote to the  Statesman in reply. His speeches, he said, were aimed at stemming strife between religious communities. He invited the planters to assist him in this ‘onerous mission’. He turned then to his ‘innocent wife who will never even know the wrong your correspondent has done her’. If Irwin were to be introduced to her, ‘he will soon find that Mrs. Gandhi is a simple woman, almost unlettered, who knows nothing about the two bazaars mentioned by him’. Her husband added, with an uncharacteristic touch of sarcasm, that ‘Mrs. Gandhi has not yet learnt the art of making speeches or addressing letters to the Press’.23 V The Champaran Enquiry Committee discussed whether sharabeshi (the rent paid in case the peasant grew something other than indigo) was illegal, and whether tinkathia—the mandatory requirement to devote a portion of one’s holdings to indigo—should be abolished. It studied the peasant testimonies supplied by Gandhi, and invited planters to state their case.  Among the planters who appeared before the committee was W.S. Irwin. ‘If Mr. Gandhi were to remain in this part of the country for the length of time I have (and it is 35 years),’ said Irwin, ‘he would be convinced what a consummate liar the Champaran ryot is.’24 The committee took a different view. The evidence placed before it by Gandhi and his colleagues had demonstrated how the peasants had been exploited and abused for decades. In partial compensation, the committee decided that on existing agreements, sharabeshi would be reduced by roughly 20 per cent. On tinkathia, the demand of the raiyats (and Gandhi) was accepted in toto, and the committee recommended ‘the voluntary system’, in which ‘the tenant must be absolutely free to enter into the contract [with the planters] or to refrain from making it.’25 The Champaran Enquiry Committee submitted its report—largely favourable to the tenants—on 3 October 1917. Gandhi then proceeded to Motihari to consult with the peasants and their leaders. On 11 October he left Motihari for Bettiah, where he was to spend two days before returning home to Ahmedabad. When his train reached Bettiah station, some 4000 people were waiting to receive him.  A police intelligence report takes up the story: No sooner the train stopped than people began to shout ‘Gandhiji ki jai’, ‘Gandhi Maharajki jai’. There were bajas [bands] and flags at the station and all men from neighbouring and distant villages including schoolboys and mukhtiars [lawyers] were present. They showered flowers on Mr. Gandhi and garlanded him. There was a red cloth spread at the platform for Mr. Gandhi. Surajmal Marwari of Bettiah had brought his phaeton and a horse of Puran Babu Raj, an engineer, was harnessed. It is not understood how Puran Babu lent his horse and why the railway servants allowed so much rush and show at the station. 26 Gandhi’s first satyagraha in India had been a success. So great had been his impact that, four years after he had left the area, an official touring Muzaffarpur and Champaran found that ‘the name of Mr.  Gandhi is still one to conjure with . . .’27 VI Since his return to India, Gandhi had travelled extensively through the subcontinent, but interacted mostly with townspeople. His stay in Champaran was his first direct experience of peasant life in his homeland. Notably, Gandhi’s campaign improved his standing in the city where he lived, Ahmedabad.  The city’s westernized professionals had previously treated him with disdain. Ahmedabad’s doctors, lawyers and professors were attached to two institutions: a discussion group named the Gujarat Sabha and a recreational space called the Gujarat Club. Neither the club nor the sabha had much time for Gandhi; nor, it must be said, he for them.  The historian David Hardiman writes that ‘before 1917, Gujarat had a reputation in nationalist circles for being a torpid backwater of ideological conservatism’. The Gujarat Sabha was dominated by loyalist lawyers, some of whom took Gandhi to be a ‘misguided religious crank’. Their attitude to him changed dramatically when Gandhi refused to obey the order to leave Champaran in April 1917.  When the news reached Ahmedabad, ‘the legal fraternity at the Gujarat Club leapt to their feet’, and decided to have this ‘brave man’ as the next president of their sabha. 28 A leading light of the Gujarat Club was Vallabhbhai Patel. Born in 1875, Patel was the son of a farmer who owned a modest ten acres of land. Because of family and farming duties his attendance at school was erratic, and he only matriculated at the age of twenty-two. He then passed the local bar exam, and became a lawyer in the district towns of Gujarat.  Patel was keen to qualify as a barrister in England. He finally travelled to London when he was thirty-five; returning with his qualification two years later, he now started practising in Ahmedabad.  He prospered professionally as well as socially, spending his evenings at the Gujarat Club. He was playing bridge at the club when he came to hear of Gandhi’s challenge in Champaran.29 Patel’s career trajectory was rather different from Gandhi’s. Gandhi came from a comfortable and completely urban background; his father and grandfather were chief ministers in princely states.  Gandhi was only nineteen when he went to England to qualify as a lawyer, his expenses met by an elder brother. Patel, on the other hand, had to pull himself out of the village, and himself fund his legal education.  We do not know precisely when Patel and Gandhi first met. It was most likely in August– September 1917. Patel had already served a term as a municipal councillor. Meeting Gandhi took him further away from his work at the bar towards full-time public service.  Two other Gujarati lawyers also joined Gandhi in the second half of 1917. Their names were Mahadev Desai and Narhari Parikh. They had studied law together in Bombay, and then moved to Ahmedabad to practise. Sometime towards the end of 1915, they came across Gandhi’s ashram manifesto, and sent him a letter criticizing the emphasis on celibacy and on handicrafts. Gandhi invited them for a discussion, after which Narhari Parikh decided to join the ashram school as a teacher.  Gandhi was happy to have Parikh work with him. But he was keener on Mahadev Desai. Desai was a scholar who had just translated John Morley’s classic work, On Compromise, into Gujarati. He also had a practical side, with a keen interest in cooperative societies. Gandhi asked Desai to come visit him every day. Finally, on 31 August, he told Desai that ‘I have found in you just the type of young man for whom I have been searching for the last two years’. He had discovered ‘three outstanding qualities’ in him, these being ‘regularity, fidelity and intelligence’. ‘I have got in you the man I wanted,’ Gandhi told Desai: ‘The man to whom I can entrust all my work some day and be at ease, and to whom I can rely with confidence.’ Mahadev Desai was charmed—and persuaded. In November 1917, he joined Gandhi as his secretary, and more. He was constantly at hand, to take notes, to translate Gandhi’s articles from Gujarati to English (and vice versa), to receive guests, and to make travel arrangements. 30 VII With more people joining, the bungalow at Kochrab was proving inadequate for the ashram. In the summer of 1917, an Ahmedabad merchant named Punjabhai Hirachand offered a plot three miles north of Kochrab. It was bare and treeless, but large, extending along the banks of the Sabarmati River. Gandhi saw its potential immediately. He was attracted by the proximity to the site of a prison.  ‘As jail-going was understood to be the normal lot of Satyagrahis,’ he wrote later, ‘I liked this position.’31 On one side of the new site was a prison; on the other, a cremation ground, also a place every satyagrahi was bound to visit. The buildings were put in place in the second half of 1917, supervised by Gandhi’s nephew Maganlal. Unlike in Kochrab, the inmates had the space to experiment with farming, weaving and animal husbandry. Their activities were supervised by Gandhi, whom everybody in the settlement called ‘Bapu’, father. 32 In the first week of November 1917, Gandhi organized the first-ever Gujarat Political Conference.  Jinnah and Tilak both attended. Asked by Gandhi to speak in their shared mother tongue, Jinnah ‘made a brave show of stammering out his speech in Gujarati’. 33 Gandhi thanked him, while (somewhat patronizingly) adding that he should practise speaking in the mother tongue. Jinnah was a member of the Imperial Legislative Council, but if reforms came and a wider franchise was granted, he might, said Gandhi, soon ‘have to approach Hindus and Muslims, Ghanchis, Golas and others not knowing English for votes. He should, therefore, learn Gujarati if he doesn’t know it.’34 Gandhi began his own speech with a joking reference to the late arrival of Tilak. He invoked the defaulter’s own famous slogan about swaraj (freedom) being his birthright. ‘If one does not mind arriving late by three-quarters of an hour at a conference summoned for the purpose,’ remarked Gandhi, ‘one should not mind if swaraj comes correspondingly late.’ Gandhi then referred to a petition being prepared for submission to the secretary of state for India, Edwin Montagu. This articulated the demand of the Congress and the Muslim League for self-government. Thousands of signatures had already been collected. Gandhi insisted that literacy by itself was not crucial for achieving swaraj: what ‘is essential is the idea itself, the desire itself’. The signatories to the resolution were all city based, and middle class. But, as Gandhi noted, ‘When the peasantry of India understands what swaraj is, the demand will become irresistible.’ In Gandhi’s view, the movement for swaraj was weak because two major constituencies had been kept away. Since the movement had only men, and no women, ‘the nation walks with one leg only’.  Besides, the educated classes had not freely mixed with the peasantry. Gandhi argued that ‘we dare not turn away from a single section of the community or disown any. We shall make progress only if we carry all with us.’35 Gandhi’s talk drew on his recent experiences in Champaran, where he had discovered the political promise of the peasantry, and witnessed how well-fed and well-dressed lawyers from the cities could be made to mingle with the masses. His convening of the conference, his treatment of Jinnah and Tilak, the contents of his own speech—all reflected a remarkable self-assurance, a growing awareness of his present and future role in the public life of India.  VIII At the conference in Godhra, Gandhi asked the Gujaratis present to tour the countryside and study peasant grievances. The monsoon in 1917 had been late and severe: seventy inches of rain instead of the usual thirty. In the otherwise prosperous district of Kheda, crops had been badly damaged. A local leader named Mohanlal Pandya got villagers to write to the authorities, asking for the postponement of land revenue in view of the failure of their crops. Some 18,000 peasants signed these letters, which were posted on 15 November, the Gujarati New Year’s Day. 36 Gandhi now wrote to the commissioner asking him to suspend land revenue for the year. When the commissioner refused, the peasants started a no-tax campaign. They were encouraged by, among others, Vallabhbhai Patel and the fiery young socialist Indulal Yagnik. The government responded by stiffening its stance, and replaced an officer sympathetic to the peasants with one known to enforce the law more strictly.37 The peasants remained defiant. They stopped supplies of milk to dairies which produced butter and cheese for troops stationed in Bombay. One station in Kheda, which usually supplied 12,000 gallons of milk to the city daily, had to be closed due to this ‘organized agitation’. 38 The unpaid dues of the peasants in Kheda were mounting. Two friends from the Servants of India Society suggested to Gandhi that a public subscription of one lakh rupees be raised to pay off the debts. This would save the peasants from going to jail or having their lands confiscated. Gandhi refused the offer, since ‘the object behind the idea of satyagraha is to make the people fearless and free, and not to maintain our own reputation anyhow’.39 As the peasant satyagraha in Kheda was developing, a conflict was emerging in Ahmedabad as well. The rains that had destroyed crops in the countryside had led to the onset of plague in the city.  By November 1917, some 550 deaths had been reported. Schools, colleges and offices had shut down.  The onset of plague led to a panic migration out of the city. This worried the textile mill owners. If the workers fled to their villages, who was to produce the fabrics? To persuade their staff to stay, the mill owners offered a ‘plague bonus’ of 75 per cent. This was to be paid to all categories of workers, except the relatively well-off warpers. These incentives permitted the mills in Ahmedabad to function while everything else came to a halt. There were now some 1,06,000 spindles at work in the city’s mills, supplying 22,000 looms. To meet the growing demand, factories worked two shifts instead of one. 40 By January 1918, the plague had subsided. The owners decided to dispense with the plague bonus.  When the workers complained, citing rising prices, they were offered—uniformly across all categories—a flat 20 per cent pay increase. This was not accepted, with the weavers in particular finding the offer hopelessly inadequate.  On 2 January, Gandhi was in Bombay. Also in the city was the Ahmedabad mill owner Ambalal Sarabhai, who had saved Gandhi’s ashram by his gift of Rs 13,000 back in 1915. When Ambalal met Gandhi in Bombay, he conveyed his concern that the workers in the mills might strike on the question of the bonus.  On returning to Ahmedabad, Gandhi asked his associates to give him data on the workers’ living conditions, and on wages in Ahmedabad’s mills as compared to other cities. The evidence suggested that the workers deserved a better deal. They wanted a flat 50 per cent increase in wages; Gandhi persuaded them to settle for 35 per cent.  However, the mill owners refused to improve on their original offer of a 20 per cent increase.  Now, as Mahadev Desai recalled, ‘an element of doggedness . . . characterized both the sides’. 41 Leading the mill owners in their obstinacy was Ambalal Sarabhai. Leading the workers in their intransigence was his sister Anasuya. This class conflict was also a family dispute, surely an unprecedented situation in the history of worker–capitalist relations in India—or anywhere else perhaps.  Heirs to a prosperous family business, the Sarabhais were orphaned early. Anasuya, who was several years older, helped bring Ambalal up. However, she was married off at thirteen to a man who would not let her attend school. Eventually, she left her husband, and went back to live with her brother.  Ambalal ran the family business while his sister ran the household. After her brother got married, Anasuya decided to go to England to fulfil her long-suppressed desire to educate herself. She attended classes at the newly founded London School of Economics and Political Science, met trade unionists, and was impressed by the commitment of the suffragettes, although their methods (stone throwing and window breaking) did not appeal to her Jain sentiments. She was admitted to St Hilda’s, a women’s college in Oxford, but before she could join, news came that her younger sister had died. Anasuya abandoned her studies and returned home. Since Ambalal was now happily married and with children of his own, she sought fulfilment outside the home. She started a day school for the children of mill-hands, and a night school for workers who were illiterate. She also helped with access to healthcare and housing. 42 Anasuya and her brother had first come into conflict in December 1917. This was when the warpers, denied the plague bonus, asked for a 25 per cent ‘dearness allowance’ instead. The demand was taken by Anasuya to her brother. When he refused, she wrote to Gandhi (then in Champaran) to intervene. He did. ‘Why should not the mill-owners feel happy paying a little more to the workers?’ wrote Gandhi to Ambalal. He added: ‘How could a brother be the cause of suffering to a sister?— and that, too, a sister like Anasuyabehn?’43 Now, two months later, the mill owners and workers were once more in disagreement. Ambalal stood with his class; Anasuya for her cause. Once more, Gandhi was asked to settle the dispute.  IX When the mill owners refused to enhance the wages by 35 per cent, Gandhi and Anasuya Sarabhai advised the workers to stop going to the factories. A millworkers’ strike began on 22 February 1918.  Every afternoon, a meeting was held outside a large babul tree on the banks of the Sabarmati. Gandhi would drive to the meeting in Anasuya’s Overland roadster, while workers would walk several miles from their chawls. At the meeting, Gandhi spoke, while a leaflet of instructions and reflections on the dispute was distributed. Afterwards, Gandhi and Anasuya drove back to her brother’s house for tea.  Gandhi had told the magnate that it was best if they discussed the dispute every day in a spirit of understanding and trust. 44 The civility between brother and sister notwithstanding, the middle class of Ahmedabad was consumed by anxiety. ‘Every one was afraid that the angry workers would cause trouble on thoroughfares, commit thefts, and provoke scuffles, and riots.’ Nothing of the sort happened. The workers remained non-violent, meeting with Gandhi every evening under the babul tree. After Gandhi had spoken, the workers began to sing, the songs freshly composed for the occasion. 45 The Gujarati leaflets distributed at these daily meetings were composed by Gandhi, Anasuya and an energetic trade unionist named Shankarlal Banker. One leaflet asked workers not to gamble, to spend their time—now that they were not at the mill—reading or repairing their homes. They were advised to work part-time as tailors or carpenters. Another leaflet recalled the satyagrahas in South Africa and the sacrifices made by the mining and plantation workers there. A third urged the strikers not to make ‘distinctions of Hindu, Muslim, Gujarati, Madrasi, Punjabi, etc.’, for ‘in public work we are all one or wish to be one’. A fourth deplored the callous attitude of the mill owners, saying, ‘we had confidently hoped that the Jain and Vaishnava employers in the capital city of this worthy land of Gujarat would never consider it a victory to beat down the workers or deliberately to give them less than their due.’46 On 1 March 1918, Gandhi wrote Ambalal Sarabhai a remarkable letter, telling him that if his class of mill owners succeeded in their aims,  the poor, already suppressed, will be suppressed still more, will be more abject than ever and the impression will have been confirmed that money can subdue everyone. If, despite your efforts, the workers succeed in getting the increase, you, and others with you, will regard the result as your failure. Can I possibly wish you success in so far as the first result is concerned? Is it your desire that the arrogance of money should increase? Or that the workers be reduced to utter submission? . . . Do you not see that in your failure lies your success, that your success is fraught with danger for you? . . . Kindly look deep into your heart, listen to the still small voice within and obey it, I pray you. Will you dine with me?47 Ambalal came over to dine with Gandhi at the ashram. What they spoke about is not recorded. At any rate, they did not reach a settlement on the question of workers’ wages.  The strike was now into its third week. The workers had begun to lose heart. The attendance at the daily meetings held by Gandhi dwindled. In the beginning, several thousand workers came. By 10 March, the figure was down to a few hundreds. Some millhands had gone back to work, accepting the magnates’ offer of a 20 per cent increase. 48 One day, Gandhi’s nephew Chhaganlal went to the Jugaldas chawl to ask the workers why they had not attended the daily meeting. A worker responded: ‘What is it to Anasuyabehn and Gandhiji? They come and go in their car; they eat sumptuous food, but we are suffering death-agonies; attending meetings does not prevent starvation.’49 When these words reached Gandhi, he recognized the truths they contained. He decided to go on a fast to force the issue. Gandhi had fasted before, but for reasons internal to the family and his ashram (such as departures from celibacy). This was the first occasion on which he chose to fast for a larger social or political purpose. The criticisms of the workers had stung him, forcing him to put his body on the line for their rights.  On 15 March, Gandhi told the workers that he would not eat, and not sit in a motorcar either. On 17 March, he invoked the example of Tilak, who had gone to jail for the national cause, and thus ‘undergone the sufferings of internment with a spiritual motive’. His own decision to fast was taken to ‘keep’ the 10,000 striking workers from ‘falling’. 50 Gandhi’s fast put pressure on the mill owners. Ambalal and his colleagues could not allow the situation to deteriorate. By the fourth day of the fast, they had been coerced into a settlement. On 18 March, the mill owners agreed to arbitration by a third party, a respected Ahmedabad academic named Anandshankar Dhruva. In the spirit of compromise the workers would be paid 35 per cent extra wages on the first day, but 20 per cent (what the employers had agreed on) on the next day, and so on till the award came. 51 Professor Dhruva gave his award only in August 1918, and it was in favour of the workers, giving them a 35 per cent increase in wages, to be paid retrospectively. In this battle of siblings, the sister had triumphed in the end.  X Gandhi now returned to the agrarian conflict in Kheda. Six months into the struggle, thousands of peasants had refused to pay the land revenue due to the government. In some talukas, the percentage of defaulters was close to 30 per cent.  On 30 March 1918, the collector ordered the confiscation of the crops of those who had not paid taxes. On 5 April, Gandhi met the collector to try and effect a compromise. The official was unyielding. Police parties raided villages, breaking locks and taking away grain, vessels, furniture and buffaloes.52 Gandhi sent Vallabhbhai Patel to canvass support in Bombay for the peasants of Kheda.  Vallabhbhai tried to meet Jinnah but failed. When he returned to Ahmedabad, he angrily told Gandhi: ‘For two long hours we waited, but Jinnah Saheb couldn’t find time to grant us an audience. And this is whom they call our Mazzini of India!’ (Gandhi’s reply is unrecorded.)53 Jinnah was a ‘Mazzini’ to the educated classes alone. Others were comparing Gandhi himself to the great Italian patriot, on the grounds that he appealed to far more than city-based lawyers and editors.  A Gujarati newspaper said that while some intellectuals dismissed villagers as ‘ignorant and illiterate’, ‘the salvation of India will be achieved only by the agriculturists. If there be a leader in India the people are ready to follow him, but the question is who should be regarded as the leader.  Italy produced only one Mazzini who brought about her regeneration. Gujarat has also produced only one Mazzini in Mr. Gandhi. May God make him infuse new life into Gujarat! It is prayed that this spiritual fight put up by the Kheda agriculturists may be closely watched by the entire agricultural class in India.’54 On 23 April, Gandhi was in Bombay, speaking at a public meeting held in solidarity with the peasants of Kheda. The struggle, he said, ‘did not originate with the Home Rulers or with any barristers or lawyers as some people allege’. Rather, it was ‘started by the tillers themselves’. Men and women had both participated equally. Gandhi had himself witnessed ‘wonderful scenes . . . at the village meetings. The women declare that even if the Government seize their buffaloes, attach their jewellery or confiscate their lands, the men must honour their pledge. This is a grand struggle . . . Its fragrance is spreading everywhere.’ Gandhi was addressing an audience many of whose members had never been to a village. His own experience in Kheda and Champaran, on the other hand, had taught him ‘this one lesson, that, if the leaders move among the people, live with them, eat and drink with them, a momentous change will come about in two years’. 55 From Bombay, Gandhi proceeded to Delhi for a conference called by the viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, aimed at soliciting support for the War. (A former governor of the Australian state of Queensland and New South Wales, Chelmsford had replaced Hardinge as viceroy in March 1916.) The conflict between Britain and Germany had entered a crucial stage. Close to a million Indians had already volunteered to fight in the War. Now, with the Germans pressing hard, a fresh round of recruits was required.  Gandhi still thought the British Empire could or would redeem itself. He still believed that if unfair laws and unjust practices were brought to the attention of the highest officials, they would be revoked or corrected. It was in this spirit, or expectation, that he responded to the viceroy’s appeal to help with the War. However, he was disappointed that Tilak had not been called for the conference, and that important Muslim leaders like Shaukat Ali and Mohammad Ali were under house arrest (on suspicion of being supporters of the Turkish state, against whom the British were at war). Gandhi boycotted the first day of the conference, but was persuaded by Charlie Andrews to show up for the second. The viceroy also met Gandhi privately, and urged him to support the recruitment drive.  Before he left Delhi, Gandhi wrote the viceroy a long and intensely felt letter. Not calling Tilak and the Ali Brothers was, he said, a ‘grave blunder’. For, they were ‘among the most powerful leaders of powerful opinion’. The protest registered, Gandhi acknowledged that in this hour of danger, it was necessary to provide ‘ungrudging and unequivocal support to the Empire, of which we aspire, in the near future, to be partners in the same sense as the Dominions overseas’.  In cooperating with the British war effort, Gandhi was acting similarly to other subjects of the Empire who hoped one day to see their nation free. The great Israeli nationalist David Ben-Gurion was even more energetic in his support for the rulers; raising, and himself volunteering for, a Jewish battalion to fight alongside the British in the Great War. As with Gandhi, the hope here was that a good turn done in the Empire’s time of crisis would be rewarded with self-rule after the crisis had passed.  Loyalty to the Empire was, in Gandhi’s mind, directly linked to the securing of Home Rule. Support for the War involved ‘the consecration of our lives to the common cause’. But since India, unlike Canada or South Africa, was not yet a partner in the Empire, this was ‘a consecration based on the hope of a better future’.  After returning to Gujarat, Gandhi wrote again to the viceroy, asking for ‘relief regarding the Kheda trouble’. If revenue was suspended for the year, he cannily argued, he and his co-workers would be free to devote their energies to getting recruits for the War. 56 Through much of May and June, Gandhi toured Kheda, asking peasants to enlist to save the Empire.  A Gujarati leaflet issued by him claimed ‘the easiest and the straightest way to win swaraj is to participate in the defence of the Empire’. Gandhi even offered to lead one unit, but without carrying arms himself. That way he would (admittedly uneasily) balance his desire to help the British with his own commitment to non-violence. The peasants were unpersuaded. On 9 July, Gandhi wrote to his son Devadas: ‘I have not had a single recruit so far, so deplorable is the plight of the country.’ Two weeks later, about 100 men—still a meagre number—had come forward. 57 Gandhi was counting on his own appeal and that of Vallabhbhai Patel. He failed, because the peasants were reluctant soldiers, and because some now saw him as a hypocrite. They were appalled that he, who had recently been counselling non-violent protest against the Raj, was now advocating that they enlist as soldiers to fight in the Empire’s cause. The attendance at his meetings was thin; on occasion, he was denied transport and food, and at one gathering, peasants shouted at him: ‘We made you great! We helped you make Satyagraha work! And see what you ask of us now.’58 That Gandhi tried so hard to get recruits did, however, make an impression on the authorities. In June, following a meeting between Gandhi and the collector of Kheda, an order was issued suspending the collection of revenue from those who could not afford it, while asking well-to-do cultivators to voluntarily pay up. 59 In Champaran and in Ahmedabad, the struggles led and conceived by Gandhi had met with a substantial degree of success. On the other hand, this third experiment with satyagraha resulted in what can (at best) be termed a face-saving compromise.  XI In the first week of March 1918, Gandhi wrote to Henry Polak’s wife, Millie: ‘I am here attending to the Kheda trouble as also a big strike. My passive resistance is therefore beginning to have full play in all the departments of life.’ The excitement was palpable. Three months later, the intensity of the struggle had begun to take its toll. In late June, he wrote to another woman friend, the secretary of his South African years, Sonja Schlesin: ‘My work has involved constant railway travelling. I am longing for solitude and rest. They may never be my lot.’60 In the first half of 1918, Gandhi was continually on the move. In his absence, the ashram in Ahmedabad limped along. Among those desolated by the patriarch’s absence was his wife Kasturba.  Her letters are lost, but from Gandhi’s replies we can tell she missed him terribly. One letter, addressed to ‘Beloved Kastur’, begins: ‘I know you are pining to stay with me. I feel, though, that we must go on with our tasks. At present, it is right that you remain where you are [in the Ashram] . . . As you come to love others and serve them, you will have a joy welling up from within.’ Working alone in the ashram was evidently little consolation for Kasturba. For, two days later, Gandhi wrote again: ‘Your being unhappy makes me unhappy. If it had been possible to bring ladies, I would have brought you. Why should you lose your head because I may have to go out? We have learnt to find our happiness in separation. If God has so willed, we shall meet again and live together. There are many useful things one can do in the Ashram and you are bound to keep happy if you occupy yourself with them.’61 Once the Kheda settlement was secured, Gandhi came back home to Kasturba and the ashram. The construction was proceeding smoothly, supervised by his nephew Maganlal. Gandhi hoped to provide accommodation for 100 people and install sixteen looms. This would cost 1,00,000 rupees, of which 40,000 had been collected. For the balance he approached his friend Pranjivan Mehta. ‘I have to tax you for a large amount,’ wrote Gandhi to Mehta. ‘Please give, if you can, what I have asked for, so that my anxieties can end.’62 From August through November, Gandhi was almost continually in Ahmedabad. His stay was not entirely voluntary. In the second week of August, he came down with a bad bout of dysentery. He was flat on his back, ‘passing through the severest illness of my life’, and could hardly write because of the pain. 63 Gandhi had vowed to abstain from milk for life. He had lived without it for the past few years. But his recent sickness had weakened him. The doctors asked him to resume drinking milk to build up his body. So did Kasturba. Gandhi was reluctant to break his vow. He wrote to the Bengali chemist P.C.  Ray to ask whether the protein provided by milk could be found in vegetables instead.  In October, Gandhi’s health turned bad again. His heartbeats became irregular. He was being administered arsenic, iron and strychnine injections to bring back his appetite. Kasturba pointed out that his vow had been taken with regard to cow’s milk only. Why could he not take goat’s milk instead? That would not be a lapse of conscience. The lawyer had been outwitted by his unlettered wife, on technical grounds. He agreed to take the substitute. 64 Gandhi’s young colleagues Narhari Parikh and Mahadev Desai found their mentor’s attitude puzzling. Either he should not have taken the vow, they said, or he should have kept to it. When Mahadev conveyed their disquiet to Henry Polak, he wrote back that at least Gandhi’s health was on the mend. ‘I only hope the improvement continues,’ wrote Polak to Mahadev. ‘I entirely share your feelings as regards his [Gandhi’s] attitude. It seems to be wholly illogical; but I prefer his lack of logic and his life to his logic and his death. In any case, his vow was illogical, and as two negatives make an affirmative, I am perfectly satisfied with the result’. 65 XII In April 1918, Gandhi’s eldest son, Harilal, was accused of embezzling funds from his employer. He wrote in panic to his father for advice. Gandhi replied: ‘What shall I write to you? Man behaves according to the impulses of his nature. But it is the dharma of every one of us to gain mastery over them. Make that effort, and all your faults will be forgotten and forgiven. Since you are emphatic that you did not commit the theft, I will believe you, but the world will not.’ Gandhi advised Harilal not to engage a pleader, but to ‘tell everything to the advocate on the other side’. The letter ended by saying that Mahadev Desai satisfies my need for you. He has taken your place, but the wish that it had been you refuses still to die. If others had not become my sons and soothed my feelings, I would simply have died of the pain of separation from you. Even now, if you wish to be an understanding son without displacing anyone who has made himself [dear] to me, your place is assured. 66 In the first week of July, Gandhi was in Nadiad, a town some forty miles from Ahmedabad. He heard (perhaps from Kasturba) that Harilal was to pass through on his way from Bombay. ‘I must go and see him,’ said Gandhi to Mahadev, and went to Nadiad station at night. One train stopped, but Harilal was not on it. Another came a little later, and Gandhi found his son ‘sound asleep in a second class compartment’. Harilal was surprised to see his father. They spoke for a while, ‘but there was no warmth in it’. Gandhi came back to where Mahadev and he were staying, ‘sorely disappointed and grieved’, remarking to his secretary that ‘the very face of the boy has undergone a change and lost its colour’. 67 Gandhi’s second son, Manilal, had been sent away to South Africa. With Albert West, he was running the Phoenix settlement and publishing the magazine Gandhi had founded in 1903, Indian Opinion. Manilal was lonely, and desperately keen to get married (he was now in his mid-twenties, well past the age at which Indian males then found their brides).  Gandhi insisted that Manilal continue to be celibate. In January 1918, Gandhi wrote to him that ‘You may consider marriage only when you can leave Indian Opinion in good order. . . . We have a thousand desires; all of them cannot be satisfied.’ To West’s sister, Gandhi wrote that if Manilal ‘can stand a few more years of bachelor life, he will get hardened’. 68 Writing to Manilal, Gandhi fretted that he ‘could not attract Harilal to my path of a truth-seeker and he dropped away from it’. He thought he might yet succeed with his second son. Gandhi told Manilal that You have stayed on in my life, but are discontented. You can’t bring yourself to go out of it, and yet do not altogether like being in it.  This is why you are not at peace with yourself. . . . I have not harmed you intentionally. All I have done I did in the belief that it was for your good. Is not this enough to bring down your anger against me? 69 This is the letter of a purist and perfectionist, of one who had radically simplified his life, abandoned his career, devoted himself to the service of society. At the same time, it is dogmatic and unfeeling.  Gandhi greatly admired the medieval poet Narasinha Mehta, whose hymn ‘ Vaishnava Jana To’ was now sung daily at his ashram. 70 Mehta’s hymn emphasized that only those who understood the pain of others could come close to God. As an upper-caste Hindu, Gandhi himself understood, and responded to, the pain of peasants, workers, Muslims and ‘untouchables’. His views on women—asking for the abolition of purdah, seeking their support in social movements—were moderately progressive for the time. And yet, for all his empathy and concern for those outside his family, Gandhi was curiously blind to the pain of his own sons.  Harilal and Manilal were both independent and strong-willed. The third son, Ramdas, was timid and shy. Gandhi did not think him capable of public work. But when Ramdas found it difficult to get stable employment, he did disappoint the father. So Gandhi pinned his hopes on his youngest son, Devadas, who was intelligent, hard-working, and less inclined to disagree with his father than the two eldest boys.  Mahadev Desai records a conversation in the spring of 1918, where Gandhi told him: Harilal threw away his whole life in a moment by one false step. I see in him all my faults magnified and my merits minimised, as we see in some special mirrors’ reflections of objects larger and smaller than their size. . . . Dev[a]das had been born to compensate me for the dissatisfaction I feel from my other three sons. 71 In June 1918, Gandhi sent Devadas, then aged eighteen, to Madras to teach Hindi to South Indians, since they were unfamiliar with what would one day become an independent nation’s lingua franca.  After six months away from home, Devadas wished to return. Gandhi told him that his ‘interest’ and ‘duty’ required him to stay on. ‘When your task in Madras is over,’ he wrote, ‘I shall satisfy your desire for studies. But believe me, the experience you have gained very few must have.’ The tone here is different from his letters to Harilal. The father would still direct and exhort, but in a gentler and kinder way. 72 XIII Gandhi had decidedly mixed success in winning his sons over to his cause. He was luckier elsewhere. As he conducted his first experiments with satyagraha, young men and, more occasionally, women flocked to his call.  In Champaran, those who came to work with Gandhi included ‘barristers, Pleaders, dismissed school masters, Politicians, local agitators . . .’73 When he started his schools in Champaran, volunteers came from across the country. They included S.L. Soman, a Marathi-speaking Brahmin from Belgaum, who was a lawyer and Sanskrit scholar; Pranlal Prabhu, a yogi from Bhavnagar in Kathiawad, who ‘lives on fruits only, does not take rice, bread, etc.’ and who distributed medicines free to the villagers; Avanti and Baban Gopal Gokhale, a couple from Bombay, he an engineer, she a teacher; and Hari D. Deo, a member of the Servants of India Society from Poona. 74 In Kheda and Ahmedabad too, idealistic young Indians came to assist Gandhi, abandoning their legal or teaching careers to do so. And he also found sustenance among the subaltern classes. In Champaran, the indigo tenants were looking to Gandhi to lead them. In his native Gujarat, peasants in the countryside and workers in the city were mobilized by Gandhi’s associates, taking their cues from what their leader asked or expected from them.  Of the educated followers whom Gandhi attracted to himself in 1917–18, three stood out. These were J.B. Kripalani, Vallabhbhai Patel and Mahadev Desai. What they had in common was independence of mind. Their admiration for Gandhi did not shade into blind reverence. They often argued with him, and sometimes even made him change his views.  Patel and Kripalani were men of action. Neither kept a diary. What we know of their early encounters with Gandhi is partial and incomplete. Mahadev Desai, on the other hand, kept a record of all that Gandhi said to him. Sometimes he also noted what he said in return. We thus know that the disciple did not always concur with what his master had to say.  In late May 1918, travelling by train in Bihar, Mahadev and Gandhi had an argument about reincarnation. Gandhi insisted that if one was a Hindu (as Mahadev certainly was) one must accept the cycle of births and rebirths. His secretary spiritedly answered: ‘Call me a non-Hindu or a Christian or whatever you like, but why should I hide what I honestly feel?’ How could a horse become a man in his next life, he asked, or a man a horse?  A month later, back in Ahmedabad, Mahadev disagreed with Gandhi once more. This time they were discussing the position of women. Gandhi said it was ‘in the very nature of womankind’ to be dependent on others. Mahadev answered that her ‘dependence is not as natural as all that’. He cited Annie Besant as an example of a woman who was truly independent. 75 In South Africa, Gandhi had a devoted secretary, Sonja Schlesin, and an outstanding second in command, Henry Polak. In March 1918, six months after Mahadev joined him, Gandhi described him to Polak as ‘a capable helper’, whose ‘ambition is to replace you. It is a mighty feat. He is making the attempt.’76 Mahadev had one great advantage over his predecessor; he was a native Gujarati speaker. Polak perhaps understood Gandhi’s political philosophy better than anyone else in South Africa. As one who had shared a home with Gandhi, he knew his personal eccentricities rather well too. However, as an Englishman, he was denied access to the mental and moral world of Gujarat and Gujarati.  Mahadev was as well read in history and politics as Polak. He had a deep love for English literature.  And he was a Gujarati, shaped by the same stock of songs, stories and sayings as Gandhi himself.  In April, Gandhi wrote to his secretary’s father: ‘Mahadev has relieved me of many of my worries.  I was in search of a loving helpmate of his character and learning. Having got Mahadev, I have succeeded in the search.’77 In May, Gandhi wrote to Mahadev himself: ‘You have made yourself indispensable to me. I meant what I wrote to Polak. . . . It is for your efficiency and character that I have chosen you to help me in my political work and you have not disappointed me. Add to this the fact that you can cook khichdi for me, with so much love.’78 Gandhi had written to his eldest son, Harilal, that Mahadev had taken his place. But Mahadev was more than a surrogate son. He also served as Gandhi’s secretary, interpreter, travel manager, interlocutor and (when necessary) cook. A year after he joined the ashram, Gandhi told his nephew Maganlal that Mahadev ‘has come to be my hands and feet, and my brain as well, so that without him I feel like one who has lost the use of legs and speech. The more I know him, the more I see his virtues. And he is as learned as [he is] virtuous.’79 Like Henry Polak—to whom Gandhi compared him—Mahadev Desai had a ready wit and great personal charm, qualities altogether rare in activists who seek to transform the world. Like Polak again, his role in the making of the Mahatma deserves to be far better known than it is.  CHAPTER FOUR Going National I In his recruitment drive in the district of Kaira, Gandhi had meagre pickings. Gujaratis were not naturally oriented towards military service. But men from other parts of India were. Punjabis, Pathans, Tamils, Malayalis, Garhwalis, Kumaunis and Purbiyas all enlisted in large numbers to serve in the World War. Some 10,00,000 Indians took up arms on behalf of the king-emperor, playing a major role in both the European and the Middle Eastern fronts.  This massive contribution to the war brought forth calls for greater rights for Indians. A leading proponent of self-government was the secretary of state for India, Edwin S. Montagu. Montagu had served as undersecretary of state for India from 1910 to 1914. He had toured India in the winter of 1912–13, and had been keen to succeed Lord Hardinge as viceroy in 1916.  The prize post of viceroy was denied Montagu, with Lord Chelmsford being appointed instead. As consolation, he was appointed secretary of state in July 1917. His Majesty’s Government had talked about giving ‘responsible government’ for India; Montagu thought this a mealy-mouthed term, preferring the more emphatic ‘self-government’ instead. He told his Cabinet colleagues that ‘if we do not use the word “Self-government”, I do not believe any announcement will fulfil its purpose, and the fact that we have avoided using it will be pounced upon by the Home Rulers.’1 In the second week of November 1917, Montagu arrived in India to expedite the process of political reform. He spent six months in the country, consulting with the viceroy and his advisers, and with governors and officials in the provinces. In between his talks he indulged himself in shikar expeditions.  Montagu kept a diary of his conversations, which offers fascinating insights into the men who ruled India. He was shocked by the racism of Europeans in the cities, whose clubs were closed to Indians.  In his view, ‘the social question, the fact that the civil servants are willing to work with the Indians but not to play with them, the fact that the Boxwallah will have nothing to do with them, has really brought the present political situation upon us.’2 Montagu spoke with a representative section of Indian opinion. Among those summoned to Delhi to meet the visitor were Jinnah and Gandhi. The secretary of state found Jinnah to be ‘young, perfectly mannered, impressive-looking, armed to the teeth with dialectics, and insistent upon the whole of his scheme’. Jinnah was ‘a very clever man’, concluded Montagu, ‘and it is, of course, an outrage that such a man should have no chance of running the affairs of his own country’.  Montagu was told that ‘at the root of Jinnah’s activities is ambition. He believes that when Mrs Besant and Tilak have disappeared he will be the leader, and he is collecting around him a group of young men, whom he says he is keeping from revolutionary movements, and professes a great influence over them.’ Also of the generation following Tilak and Besant was Mohandas K. Gandhi. Montagu had been briefed about the conflict in Champaran and the Gujarati’s role in it. Meeting Gandhi immediately after Jinnah, Montagu jotted down his impressions of the man: ‘He is a social reformer; he has a real desire to find grievances and to cure them, not for any reason of self-advertisement, but to improve the conditions of his fellow men. . . . He dresses like a coolie, forswears all personal advancement, lives practically on the air, and is a pure visionary. He does not understand details of schemes; all he wants is that we should get India on our side.’3 On 13 December, when in the bath in Calcutta’s Government House, Montagu had an idea that ‘seems to me the most brilliant that has ever entered my head’. This was to ask the prime minister to appoint Sir S.P. Sinha, the eminent lawyer who had been the first Indian member of the viceroy’s executive council, secretary of state for India. Montagu would voluntarily take a demotion and become his undersecretary. This would be an object lesson for arrogant ICS officers, that ‘a British statesman who, however undeservedly, has reached Cabinet rank, finds nothing derogatory in assisting rather than controlling an Indian’.  Montagu believed that ‘the dead hand of the Government of India is over everything, blighting it’.  His scheme of reform rested on three pillars: wider representation, provincial autonomy and absolute racial equality.4 His conservative Cabinet colleagues thought he was giving Indians too much, too quickly. Within India, the governors of provinces damned his scheme ‘all the way up hill and down dale’.5 The viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, was also lukewarm. In July 1918, a ‘Montagu–Chelmsford’ scheme was announced, a compromise decidedly weighted in favour of the latter party. Montagu had asked for ‘complete provincial decentralization’. Instead, the Government of India retained a tight leash, by dividing administrative categories into ‘reserved’ and ‘transferred’. The former remained under the control of the unelected governor (always an Englishman) and his unelected officials, while the latter were to be dealt with by elected ministers under the overall supervision of the governor.  ‘Reserved’ categories included finance, law and order, justice, development of mineral resources, factories, and the control/censorship of books, films and newspapers. Thus, in practice, every major economic and political subject was under the direct control of the governor and his advisers.  ‘Transferred’ categories included health and education, agriculture and fisheries, and such fields as ‘weights and measures; libraries, museums, and zoological gardens’.6 The franchise on which the members of provincial legislatures would be elected was based on a property and income qualification, which excluded the vast majority of the population. For example, of the 42 million residents of the Madras Presidency, only half a million would be voters; of the 20 million in the Punjab, a mere 2,37,000. Prosperous Bombay was slightly better served—with about 6,50,000 voters in a population of 21 million (this still less than 4 per cent). Women were excluded altogether, since the government felt that ‘the social conditions of India’ made it ‘premature’ to extend the franchise to them. (Women in Britain had only just been permitted to vote.) Montagu’s scheme for self-government was massively watered down by the viceroy and his council. His daring, even revolutionary, proposal to elevate Sir S.P. Sinha to his own post was not accepted by the prime minister. Instead, Sinha was appointed undersecretary of state for India, serving as Montagu’s deputy so that it remained clear to all concerned (not least Montagu) that Indians needed guidance and direction from above.  II In October 1917, the Bolsheviks had taken power in Russia. This increased the already intense paranoia of the Government of India. In December, it appointed a committee to inquire into ‘the nature and extent of the criminal conspiracies connected with the revolutionary movement in India’, and to advise on the legislation needed to deal effectively with the (real or imaginary) threat this movement posed.  These revolutionaries were most active in Bengal, where young Hindus, devoted to Goddess Kali and to a cult of sacrifice, had formed secret societies where they manufactured bombs and plotted murders of colonial officials. Their activities achieved mixed success: although many acts were planned, few were successfully carried out.7 The new committee was to be chaired by Justice Sidney Rowlatt, a high court justice in England. It had four other members, two British, two Indian. Edwin Montagu was in Bombay when Justice Rowlatt’s ship landed. When they met, the liberal politician explained to the judge that ‘government by means of internment and police was naturally a delightful method which built up only trouble for our successors, and that I hoped he would remember what was parliamentarily defensible in listening to the plan which had been prepared for him by the Government’.8 The advice was disregarded. In April 1918, Justice Rowlatt submitted his report to the Government of India. The first part, replete with charts and tables, documented acts of violence such as assassinations, murders, dacoities and bomb attacks. There was one chapter apiece on revolutionary activities in Bombay, Madras, the United Provinces and the Punjab, but five chapters on Bengal alone.  The evidence assembled by his committee, said Justice Rowlatt, showed ‘that the intentions of the revolutionaries were eventually to subvert by violent means British rule in India, and meanwhile to assassinate Government officials, to obtain such help as might be obtainable from the Indian army, and to finance their enterprises by plundering their fellow-countrymen’.  Until the outbreak of the World War, the troublemakers had all been Hindus. However, when the War found Turkey and Britain on opposite sides, some Muslims also became disaffected with the Raj.  Now, ‘Muhammadan fanatics’ were working ‘to provoke first sedition and then rebellion in India’.  The second part of the Rowlatt report outlined ways to tame and defeat revolutionary terrorism.  Noting ‘the remarkable length of trials in India’, Justice Rowlatt recommended that seditious crimes be tried by a three-judge bench without juries. ‘It is of the utmost importance,’ he argued, ‘that punishment or acquittal should be speedy, both in order to secure the moral effect which punishment should produce and also to prevent the prolongation of the excitement which the proceedings may set up.’ His committee suggested that all trials be held in camera; that the press and the public be excluded; and that no part of the proceedings be disclosed.9 When a copy of the report reached Edwin Montagu in London, he was dismayed. ‘There is much in its recommendations which is most repugnant to my mind,’ he wrote to the viceroy. During the War, the government had promulgated a Defence of India Act which mandated restricted liberties and strict censorship; why, asked Montagu, had Rowlatt retained these harsh provisions even though the War was coming to an end? Invoking by name two of the more reactionary governors in India (of Madras and Punjab), Montagu said he would ‘hate to give the Pentlands of this world and the O’Dwyers the chance of locking a man up without trial’.  The viceroy wrote back defending the report. In ‘the face of the Bengal anarchic movement’, he said, ‘it would be impossible for my Government to do otherwise than come forward with legislation carrying out the [Rowlatt] Committee’s recommendations’. He hoped the secretary of state would assent to the proposed legislation, which was required (in his view) ‘to defend our friends in India from the criminal few’.10 III In the first months of 1918, Gandhi was active in the Kheda and Ahmedabad satyagrahas. At the time, he was apparently not aware of the Rowlatt Committee. The committee’s report was for restricted circulation; while Montagu got a copy, Gandhi and other Indian leaders would not have been sent one.  Gandhi spent the second half of 1918 mostly in his ashram in Ahmedabad. He had a bad bout of dysentery, and did not recover in time to attend the 1918 Congress, held in December in Calcutta. The following month, Gandhi went to Bombay to be operated on for piles. He was sedated, and slept fitfully. Mahadev Desai, by his hospital bedside, heard him speaking in his sleep. Mahadev, characteristically, began to take notes. We thus know that ‘the last outburst during [Gandhi’s] delirium was very significant: “These two things are a ‘must’ for the Government. It has to annul the Salt Tax and nationalize the milk industry. It passes my understanding how such a cruel tax as this on salt was meekly accepted by the people. The whole country could have been inflamed to revolt against the Government at the time the law was passed. How could there be a tax on salt so indispensable to human life?”’11 From Bombay, Gandhi proceeded to Ahmedabad for a month of rest and recuperation. While he was there, the government published two bills based on the recommendations of the Rowlatt Committee. Now that the bills were public, Gandhi immediately recognized the opportunity for popular mobilization that they represented. His dream in Bombay seemed to convey a desire to take up a cause that would affect all of India. The Salt Act could wait: why not inflame the country to revolt against this new bill instead?  In South Africa, Gandhi had often challenged particular laws: a law which mandated that Indians carried passes, a law that disallowed Hindu and Muslim marriages, a law that made every Indian labourer pay a tax. In India itself, he had conducted three localized satyagrahas: with indigo farmers in Champaran; peasants in Kaira; and workers in Ahmedabad. However, like the Salt Tax, the Rowlatt Act affected not one particular district but the whole of British India. A movement against it would allow Gandhi to define—or redefine—himself as a national leader.  On 8 February 1919, Gandhi wrote to Madan Mohan Malaviya proposing a countrywide agitation against the ‘obnoxious’ Rowlatt Bills if they were not withdrawn. The next day he told Srinivasa Sastri that Malaviya and he should resign from the Imperial Legislative Council in protest. The Rowlatt Bills, said Gandhi, were ‘evidence of a determined policy of repression’; therefore, ‘civil disobedience seems to be a duty imposed upon every lover of personal and public liberty’. The same day he wrote to a South African friend: ‘The Rowlatt Bills have agitated me very much. It seems I shall have to fight the greatest battle of my life.’12 In the last week of February, Gandhi convened a meeting in his ashram in Ahmedabad. Those in attendance included Vallabhbhai Patel, Sarojini Naidu, the Bombay merchant Umar Sobani and B.G.  Horniman, the British-born, India-loving editor of the nationalist newspaper, the Bombay Chronicle.  At this meeting a ‘Satyagraha Pledge’ was drawn up, whose signatories would court arrest unless the Rowlatt Bills were withdrawn.  Also at this meeting was Jamnadas Dwarkadas, a young protégé of Annie Besant’s who was gradually being drawn towards Gandhi. Mrs Besant herself was sceptical of the uses of satyagraha, resting her faith instead in meetings, speeches, books, newspaper articles and petitions. Her protégé now tried to explain the merits of Gandhi’s method to her. In satyagraha, wrote Dwarkadas, There is no hatred, no bitterness of any kind. The government’s action [in bringing about the Rowlatt Bills] shows that their conscience is sleeping, so the satyagrahi tries to awaken the conscience of the government . . . by civilly disobeying some laws and inviting punishment on himself. A number of people doing that will make the rulers realize that they have done a grievous wrong, and ultimately will have to give in. Gandhi thinks that this is a weapon patent to India, and will teach a lesson not to our rulers only, but to the world, and will enable us to proclaim ourselves as supreme teachers of spirituality. 13 IV From his South African days, Gandhi had followed a standard procedure: threaten a movement against an unfair or unjust law, but not begin the protests before giving the authorities the chance to withdraw it. Here, too, he wrote to the viceroy after the 24 February meeting, asking him to withdraw the bills, since even the ‘most autocratic’ government ‘finally owes its power to the will of the governed’.  Lord Chelmsford did not respond, so Gandhi travelled to Delhi to seek an interview in person.  They met on 5 March, with Gandhi writing later to his son Devadas that ‘the talk was extremely cordial and friendly. I got the impression that both of us understand each other, but neither succeeded in convincing the other. An Englishman will not be argued into yielding; he yields only under compulsion of events.’14 From Delhi, Gandhi visited Lucknow and Allahabad, taking soundings and having meetings on the Rowlatt Bills. In Allahabad he stayed with Motilal Nehru, a prominent local lawyer active in Congress circles, who had supported Gandhi’s movement in South Africa. Motilal’s son, Jawaharlal, had studied science at Cambridge and later qualified as a lawyer too. Practice at the Allahabad Bar bored him; now, with Gandhi staying at their home, the younger Nehru began contemplating a career in nationalist politics. Motilal was lukewarm about Gandhi’s plans for civil disobedience, whereas his son Jawaharlal was ‘afire with enthusiasm and wanted to join the Satyagraha Sabha immediately’. 15 From the United Provinces Gandhi returned to Bombay, giving more speeches on the Rowlatt Bills.  By mid-March, there were 600 signatories to the Satyagraha Pledge in the Bombay Presidency. ‘The younger generation appears to be catching on very enthusiastically,’ said an intelligence report, ‘and the cloth merchants have determined to follow Gandhi through thick and thin.’16 Meanwhile, the government had passed one of the Rowlatt Bills into law. This prompted several Indian members to resign from the Imperial Legislative Council. They included Jinnah who, in a powerful speech, called the Acts ‘admittedly obnoxious and decidedly coercive’. In his opinion, ‘the Government that passes or sanctions such a law in times of peace, forfeits its claim to be called a civilized Government . . .’17 The government remained intransigent. On the other side, funds were pouring in for Gandhi’s movement, mostly from cotton merchants and wealthy lawyers. The money was used for the printing of posters, and the travel and board of leaders. 18 In early March, Gandhi received an invitation to visit Madras. The invitation came from C.  Rajagopalachari, a brilliant, self-made lawyer who had for some time admired Gandhi.  Rajagopalachari had sent money to support Gandhi’s work in South Africa, translated his writings into Tamil, and written articles about him in the Madras press.  Gandhi had a deep fondness for the people of the Tamil country. They had sustained his struggle in Natal and the Transvaal; perhaps they would do the same now? He left Bombay on 16 March, reaching Madras two days later. Shortly after his arrival, he learnt that the Imperial Legislative Council in Delhi had passed the second Rowlatt Bill.  Gandhi spent five days in Madras. He gave several public talks, these translated into Tamil by Rajagopalachari. In the evenings the two had long conversations about the meanings of satyagraha.  Gandhi was impressed by the lawyer’s intelligence, and by his willingness to abandon his career to court arrest.19 Gandhi proceeded next to the temple towns of Tanjore and Madurai, carrying on to Tuticorin, Trichy and Nagapattinam. To bring the audiences to his side, he spoke of the Tamils who had sacrificed their livelihood, their properties and even their lives in the struggles led by him in South Africa.  Speaking in Tuticorin on 28 March, Gandhi announced that Sunday, 6 April, would witness a nationwide statement of protest against the Rowlatt Bills. People were asked to observe a day-long fast, and hold public meetings demanding that the secretary of state for India repeal the legislation. 20 It was in early February that Gandhi first thought of launching an agitation against the Rowlatt Act.  Within a month, he had garnered support from across the country. He was helped by one enormous stroke of luck: Bal Gangadhar Tilak was away in England, fighting a court case. Tilak was a militant who had in the past taken to the streets. He also had a much longer record of public service than Gandhi, and was much better known (and more widely admired) across India. Had Tilak been around, Gandhi might not have acted so swiftly and autonomously. Tilak’s absence allowed Gandhi to set himself up as the leader of a mass movement against a law that in theory threatened every Indian.  V Gandhi had called for an all-India hartal to be observed on Sunday, 6 April 1919. But some eager nationalists in Delhi decided to observe it on the previous Sunday itself. On 30 March, young men moved around the streets of the capital of British India, shouting slogans in praise of Gandhi and in condemnation of the Rowlatt Act. In the narrow, densely crowded streets of the Old City, the protesters clashed with the police. The conflict escalated, and a detachment of infantrymen was sent to restore order. Tear gas and rubber bullets were answered by sticks and stones. Finally, the troops fired live bullets, killing at least eight people and injuring many others.21 On 3 April, the prominent Bengali Moderate Surendranath Banerjee wrote to the ‘home member’ of the viceroy’s council, suggesting that a commission be appointed to inquire into the incident in Delhi, and Gandhi be made a member. ‘Such a committee would help to soothe public feeling and the appointment of Mr. Gandhi would serve to deepen the favourable impression,’ he wrote. Besides, putting Gandhi to committee work would ‘take him away from the work of agitation in which he is over engaged’.22 The home member rejected Banerjee’s suggestion, leaving Gandhi free to go ahead with his planned day of protest on 6 April.  Gandhi had decided to lead the hartal in Bombay. He arrived at the Chowpatty beach by 6.30 a.m.  People bathed in the sea and then came and sat around him. By 8 a.m. a ‘huge mass of people’ had assembled. One reporter estimated that 1,50,000 were present—‘Mahomedans, Hindus, Parsis, etc., and one Englishman’. In his speech, Gandhi referred to the recent police firing on the satyagrahis in Delhi, and then asked the crowd to endorse the resolutions asking the viceroy to withdraw the Rowlatt Act. Reminding the crowd of the sacrifice ‘of the innocents of Delhi’, he asked them to ‘promise that we shall continue to suffer by civil disobedience till the hearts of the rulers are softened’.23 An Urdu weekly published in Bombay termed the hartal against the Rowlatt Act a ‘splendid success’. The government’s passing of the bills had ‘united the Hindus and the Musalmans like sugar and water, although these two communities once stood apart from one another owing to the long-standing differences between them’. This was a genuine mass upsurge, wrote the weekly, and ‘it is wrong to suppose that Mahatma Gandhi or any other person is the originator of the movement.  Hundreds of Gandhis will be produced from the soil of India.’24 Other cities and towns also observed the hartal called by Gandhi on 6 April, and likewise in the spirit of inter-religious solidarity. Karachi, one local newspaper reported, ‘closed its shops and centres of business: when did such a stupendous thing happen before in the history of the city? . . .  One was impressed at yesterday’s function with one soul-stirring fact—the disappearance of communal, parochial and sectarian impulses. They were “Hindus”, “Muhammadans”, “Parsis”,  “Khojas”, “Jains”, yesterday; but they all felt they belonged to one community—the Indian; they all felt there was the One Religion in various religions, the Religion of Self-respect, the Religion of guarding India’s rights for the service of Humanity.’25 In Patna, capital of Bihar, ‘nearly all shops closed’ on 6 April, and a mass meeting in the evening was attended by more than 10,000 people. Orissa was largely quiet, but Bengal was not—with shops closing in the towns of Dacca, Murshidabad and Midnapore, as well as the great city of Calcutta.  Madras observed a complete hartal, with close to 1,00,000 people congregating on the beach in the evening. Other towns in the Presidency—Tanjore, Madurai, Kumbakonam, Chittoor—also responded to Gandhi’s call. 26 In the days after 6 April, Gandhi had printed a series of leaflets for satyagrahis. One listed a series of books/booklets prohibited by the censor—such as a life of the Egyptian patriot Mustafa Kemal Pasha and Gandhi’s own Hind Swaraj. By printing and distributing these banned works, the satyagrahis could court arrest. (Under a provision of the new bill, anyone carrying a ‘prohibited’ publication could be sent to jail for two years.) A second leaflet asked the satyagrahis to take a ‘swadeshi’ vow committing themselves to wearing clothes of cotton, grown, spun and woven in India.  A third asked nationalists to take this pledge: With God as witness we Hindus and Mahomedans declare that we shall behave towards one another as children of the same parents, that we shall have no differences, that the sorrows of each will be the sorrows of the other and that each shall help the other in removing them. We shall respect each other’s religion and religious feelings and shall not stand in the way of our respective religious practices. We shall always refrain from violence to each other in the name of religion. 27 VI Gandhi was now very keen to travel to the Punjab. He had not previously visited that politically conscious province, which had taken an active part in the swadeshi movement of 1905–07. More recently, it was the centre of the Ghadar movement, where Sikhs who had migrated to North America returned to the Punjab to mobilize the peasantry. Many Punjabis had also served in the World War, often forcibly recruited by the British.  Gandhi was quite well known in the Punjab. As the chief secretary of the province later recalled, in one speech ‘the coming of Mr. Gandhi was compared to the coming of Christ, to the coming of Muhammad and the coming of Krishna. Now that was the man who, if I should use the words of a speaker at Amritsar, was to break the power of the bureaucracy, that was the man around whom the whole of the agitation centred; that was the man who by his new device of passive resistance was to relieve the people of the burden with which they were threatened.’28 On 8 April, Gandhi boarded a train to Delhi, from where he hoped to proceed to the Punjab. When the Government of India heard of his plans, they consulted the chief commissioner of Delhi and the lieutenant governor of Punjab, both of whom said ‘it would be most dangerous to allow Mr. Gandhi to enter their jurisdictions’. If he came he would have to be arrested, since ‘his avowed intention was to break the law of the land’.29 The government now decided to stop Gandhi. At the station of Kosi Kalan (about sixty miles short of his immediate destination), the police served Gandhi an order prohibiting him from entering Delhi and the Punjab, and restricting his movements to the Bombay Presidency. 30 The detention of Gandhi provoked protests all across India. Shops and offices shut down in Bombay. In Calcutta, a large crowd gathered at the Nakhoda mosque, with Hindus mixing with Muslims. 31 On the morning of 10 April, when the news of Gandhi’s arrest reached Ahmedabad, workers in mills downed tools, and shops shut down. The next day, a rumour gathered ground that Anasuya Sarabhai had also been arrested. This led to a riot, with an excited crowd, composed largely of millhands, attacking Europeans, torching government buildings and looting the homes of officials.  The trouble continued the next day, and subsided only when troops were called in to fire at the rioters and the city placed under martial law. At least twenty-three people were killed and more than 100 injured in the shooting. 32 Gandhi returned to Ahmedabad on 13 April. When he heard of the violence caused in his name, he broke down. He was ‘exceedingly ashamed’ to hear of the disturbances in his city. He wrote to the viceroy that he had ‘over-calculated the measure of permeation of satyagraha among the people’. But, he added, externing him from the Punjab was itself a ‘grievous blunder’, since ‘the mad incendiarism that has taken place in Ahmedabad would never have occurred, if the orders had not been served upon me. . . . Rightly or wrongly, I seem to command, at the present moment, in an excessive degree the respect and affection of the people all over India.’33 On 14 April, Gandhi addressed a large meeting in his ashram. The recent happenings in the city were, he said, ‘most disgraceful’. He had said ‘times without number that satyagraha admits of no violence, no pillage, no incendiarism; and still in the name of satyagraha, we burnt down buildings, forcibly captured weapons, extorted money, stopped trains, cut off telegraph wires, killed innocent people and plundered shops and private houses’. These events in Ahmedabad had ‘most seriously damaged the satyagraha movement’. Had ‘an entirely peaceful agitation followed my arrest’, added Gandhi, ‘the Rowlatt Act would have been out or on the point of being out of the Statute-book today.  It should not be a matter of surprise if the withdrawal of the Act is now delayed.’ Gandhi had now decided to ‘offer satyagraha against ourselves for the violence that has occurred’.  This would take the form of a seventy-two-hour fast. Gandhi asked those assembled to also ‘observe a twenty-four-hour fast in slight expiation of these sins’. 34 Gandhi’s address, reported the Bombay government, ‘had a very beneficial effect and the disturbances at Ahmedabad practically came to an end on . . . 14th April’ itself. 35 VII Against this backdrop of the hartal on the 6th, Gandhi’s detention on the 8th, and the violent protests on the 10th, there occurred a fascinating exchange of letters between Gandhi and Rabindranath Tagore. Apart from being India’s most famous writer, Tagore was also a social reformer, who preached against caste and religious discrimination, and was establishing a ‘University of the World’ in his native Bengal.  When he planned his satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act, Gandhi was very keen to get Tagore’s blessing. On 5 April, he wrote to the poet that he was anxious to gather for the satyagraha campaign ‘the ennobling assistance of those who approve it. I will not be happy until I have your considered opinion on this endeavour to purify the political life of the country.’ Gandhi was hoping for an endorsement; what he got instead were words of caution. Tagore acknowledged that Gandhi returned to the ‘motherland in the time of her need to remind her of her mission . . . to purge her present-day politics of its feebleness . . .’ But he warned that passive resistance is a force which is not necessarily moral in itself; it can be used against truth as well as for it. The danger inherent in all force grows stronger when it is likely to gain success, for then it becomes temptation.  Tagore knew that Gandhi’s own desire was to ‘fight against evil by the help of the good’. But ‘such a fight’, he warned, ‘is for heroes and not for men led by impulses of the moment’. 36 The words were prescient. As the violence that followed Gandhi’s arrest demonstrated, not all those who joined his movement had his own calm resolution and steady commitment to non-violence.  On 18 April, Gandhi announced the suspension of civil disobedience. He hoped satyagraha could be resumed in a few months, by which time his associates would have spread and cultivated a spirit of disciplined non-violence.37 VIII As Gandhi started and stopped his movement in the Bombay Presidency, events were moving swiftly in the Punjab. Three days after the hartal of 6 April was Ram Navami, the festival celebrating the birth of Lord Ram. This was normally observed by Hindus alone. But on this day in Amritsar,  ‘contrary to previous practice, the festival was very largely participated in by Muhammadans, and along with the usual shouts political cries were freely raised, “Mahatma Gandhi ki Jai”, “Hindu– Mussalman ki jai”’.  On the evening of 9 April, orders were issued for the deportation of two prominent local Congressmen, Satyapal and Dr Saifuddin Kitchlew. One was Hindu, the other Muslim. When news of Gandhi’s arrest reached Amritsar on 10 April, a large and angry crowd collected on the streets.  British banks were set on fire and three bank managers murdered. A female missionary was beaten up and left for dead.  The violence continued through the 10th and the 11th. With the police unable to control the crowds, the city was placed under de facto martial law. The collector handed over charge to Brigadier General Reginald Dyer, who had come with a contingent of Gurkha and Pathan troops.  The martial law regime in the Punjab was extremely harsh. Mail was censored. Temples and mosques were closed to worshippers. Water and electricity was cut off from the homes of those whose political affiliations were suspect. Worse still were public floggings of select rebels; and most incredible was an order making it mandatory for all Indians to crawl along the street that had witnessed the attack on the woman missionary.38 The protesters remained defiant. They called for a meeting to be held at one of the town’s public parks, Jallianwala Bagh, on the afternoon of 13 April. General Dyer issued a proclamation banning the meeting, sending soldiers with megaphones into the streets to warn people against attending. A crowd of several thousand gathered nonetheless. Enraged that his proclamation was disregarded, Dyer proceeded to the meeting place with some fifty soldiers and two armoured cars.  The 13th of April was Baisakhi, Sikh New Year’s Day. From the morning, pilgrims had filed into the Golden Temple. After visiting the shrine, many worshippers walked over to the nearby Jallianwala Bagh, to rest and chat in the park before returning home. By the time Dyer reached the park, this mixed crowd of protesters and worshippers was several thousand strong.  The armoured cars could not negotiate the narrow lanes of the old town, so Dyer and his men disembarked and proceeded on foot. Having deployed his troops, the general at once gave orders to open fire on the crowd facing him in the enclosure. In panic the crowd dispersed, towards the park’s single entrance, now blocked by the troops. Dyer shouted to his men to continue shooting. Asking them to reload their magazines, he personally directed fire at the densest parts of the crowd. Some 1650 rounds were fired. Almost 400 people died in the carnage.39 The drama, intensity and brutality of the week’s events are all captured in the diary of J.P.  Thompson, the chief secretary of the Punjab at the time. On 6 April, Thompson noted down the popular rumours about the Rowlatt Bills. ‘Few understand what it is. One story is that police permission will be required for weddings and funerals. Another that anyone who does not salaam a policeman will be arrested.’ The hartal called by Gandhi for 6 April was ‘complete’ in Amritsar and in ‘most towns of importance’.  On 8 April, the chief secretary confided to his diary that ‘the situation is serious. Gandhi and company have started hawking prescribed pamphlets in the streets of Bombay.’ On the 9th, he noted Gandhi’s departure for Delhi: ‘We have sent an order directing him not to enter the Punjab.’ The next day was described as ‘memorable’; with a crowd of 5000 rushing the civil station in Amritsar, and burning the town hall. ‘Troops fired—30 casualties.’ Thompson seems to have ignored his diary on 14 April. The entry for the 12th deals with Lahore where troops marched through the city, closing the magnificent Badshahi mosque to worshippers.  ‘Temper of mob very bad,’ noted the chief secretary grimly. Portraits of the king and queen were smashed, and at least two railway stations looted.  The entry for 13 April reads: ‘Late at night mutilated wire came through from Amritsar. . . .  Meeting held in spite of prohibition—200 killed!’ On the 14th, at a party at the Governor’s House, Thompson met Watkins, the principal of Amritsar’s Khalsa College, who told him that in Jallianwala Bagh the troops ‘shot men down like rabbits as they ran’, adding, ‘in an excited state’ that the ‘only thing that can save the situation was that LG [the lieutenant governor] should disown action taken’.  Thompson’s own view was that while it ‘seems to have been a bloody business—200–300 killed in a garden’, ‘probably it will be justified by [the] result’.40 IX Under martial law, there was strict press and postal censorship in the Punjab. The facts of the Jallianwala Bagh incident were largely unknown to the outside world. But rumours and counter-rumours were rife.  A month after the massacre in Amritsar, Gandhi wrote to the viceroy’s private secretary: ‘I have not said a word about the events in the Punjab, not because I have up to now not thought or felt over them, but because I have not known what to believe and what not to believe.’41 In early June, the first reports on the Amritsar massacre began appearing in the Indian press.  Gandhi now broke his public silence on the Punjab, with an article criticizing the imprisonment of Kalinath Roy, the editor of the province’s leading English paper, the Tribune. Roy had been tried and jailed for sedition, when in fact, his writings were marked by ‘sobriety’ and ‘self-restraint’. Gandhi next took up the case of Radha Krishna, the editor of Pratap, likewise sent to jail by the Punjab government for allegedly inflammatory articles. He urged that he be released too.42 Gandhi’s writings were now appearing regularly in a weekly called Young India. This journal was started by Shankarlal Banker and Umar Sobani in Bombay. In May, the government suspended the widely read Bombay Chronicle newspaper and deported its editor, B.G. Horniman, for taking the side of the anti-Rowlatt agitators. To fill the gap, Young India now became a biweekly. Gandhi and Mahadev Desai also began the process of shifting it to Ahmedabad. 43 While it was being published in Bombay, Young India carried advertisements. Those paying for space included soap and almirah merchants, jewellers, booksellers, an orphanage that was an ‘ideal institution for Homeless Hindus of all ages and both sexes’, and a certain A. Ratna and Co., Madras, who for Re 1 plus postage would supply a ‘fine photo of Mr. M.K. Gandhi’.  After the magazine shifted to Ahmedabad in early October 1919, it reverted to being a weekly, and stopped carrying advertisements. Young India now reprinted, in full, statements and speeches by Gandhi. Each issue also carried one and frequently several articles especially written by him for the journal. In the autumn of 1919, for example, Gandhi published more than a dozen articles about the Punjab—these dealing with the plight of the families whose members had been killed in the Amritsar firing, miscarriages of justice and the apathy of officials.  X The satyagraha had been suspended. Gandhi now turned his attention away from politics and to the promotion of spinning and weaving. He had long believed that the decline of handicrafts was one of the causes of India’s poverty. In the past, weaving had been an important subsidiary occupation in villages, taking up the slack in the lean season. Machine-made goods had destroyed India’s hand-spun textile industry. Its rejuvenation was key to Gandhi’s plans for national renewal. In his ashram, he had set up looms, and made it mandatory for members to spin every day.  For Gandhi, swaraj and swadeshi, freedom and self-reliance, went hand in hand. In the summer and autumn of 1919, he gave many talks on the importance of economic self-reliance. Speaking in Bombay, he said that ‘because of its neglect of swadeshi, the nation has been ruined’. Speaking in the town of Godhra, he said that if the free hours of men and women in rural homes were occupied in spinning and weaving, crores of rupees of foreign exchange would be saved. 44 A journalist from Madras, coming to meet him in Bombay, found Gandhi sitting cross-legged on a couch, wearing handwoven clothes, writing a letter to a friend in Gujarati, using materials ‘of the more common swadeshi type’. The ‘paper was none too fine, the pencil had to be pressed hard to make an impression, and the envelope would not easily open in the prevailing [monsoon] weather’.  The reporter (a westernized Tamil Brahmin) also noticed ‘that one of the curls of [Gandhi’s] spectacles had broken midway and was being held in position by a piece of thread knotted round his head. I was wondering why a fresh curl had not been put in, but soon found a broken curl was not without its uses, as it serves well enough for a toothpick on occasions.’ The journalist asked what Gandhi’s message was for the people of South India. He replied: ‘I want every man, woman and child to learn hand-spinning and weaving.’45 The theme of swadeshi also figured heavily in Gandhi’s personal correspondence. Writing to Jinnah in the last week of June, he said, ‘Pray tell Mrs. Jinnah [the erstwhile Ruttie Petit] that I shall expect her on her return to join the hand-spinning class that Mrs. Banker Senior and Mrs. Ramabai, a Punjabi lady, are conducting [in Bombay].’ Then he gratuitously added, ‘And, of course, I have your promise that you would take up Gujarati and Hindi as quickly as possible. May I then suggest that like Macaulay you learn at least one of these languages on your return voyage [from England]? ’46 Jinnah was a political colleague. Their relations were civil, though by no means warm. But even to perfect strangers, Gandhi was prone to offer similar advice. The Bombay Presidency now had a new governor, George Lloyd. Gandhi had been unsuccessfully seeking an interview with him for some time. While the request was being processed, he sent the governor’s private secretary a note explaining his programme of swadeshi, and its importance for the economic survival of the peasantry, for whom spinning and weaving could become ‘an automatic famine insurance’. He then made four requests of the governor. The first three were straightforward—viz., that the governor issue a statement approving of hand-spinning and hand-weaving, that the registrar of cooperative societies be instructed to encourage these activities, and that district officers be instructed likewise.  The last request was more unusual. Thus Gandhi wrote: And, if it is not a presumption, I would respectfully ask H.E. on my behalf to secure Lady George Lloyd’s patronage for my spinning classes. Several titled ladies are, with a view to encouraging the industry among the poor classes, taking spinning lessons. I would consider it an honour to be allowed to present a spinning-wheel to Her Excellency and to send her a lady teacher or to give her the lessons myself. I may mention that the art of spinning is incredibly easy to learn. 47 This was cheeky, even insolent, reflecting Gandhi’s extraordinary sense of self-belief. That his proposal could ever be accepted beggars the imagination—a titled and grandly dressed English lady, meant to grace ballrooms, racecourses, and guards of honour, squatting on the floor of her palace while working on a wooden spinning wheel, instructed by a little brown man in a loincloth.  XI Swadeshi and hand-spinning were interests of long-standing. Meanwhile, Gandhi had discovered a new cause, the protection of the Ottoman Caliphate. The sultan of Turkey had himself been the khalifa of Islam, the protector of the holy shrines in Mecca and Medina. Now, with the defeat of the Ottomans in the War, Indian Muslims feared that Turkey would not get justice from the Allies (since it had sided with Germany). They worried that the Ottoman Empire would be dismembered, the sultanate itself abolished, and the status of Islam’s holiest shrines called into question.  In theory, the caliph was both the spiritual and temporal head of the Sunni Muslims. After Mughal rule was finally extinguished in India in 1857, the Ottoman sultan was the only major Sunni potentate, and he began to be acknowledged as the true caliph in India. His name was read out in Friday prayers across the subcontinent. When the Ottomans fought against the Russians in 1877 and against the Greeks twenty years later, Indian Muslims raised funds for them. 48 Gandhi had long been aware of the respect the Muslims of India had for the caliph in Istanbul. In August 1900, when he was a lawyer in Durban, he was commissioned to draft an address on behalf of the Indian Muslims of Natal to ‘His Imperial Majesty Ghazi Abdul Hamid Khan, Sultan of Turkey, Ameer-ul-Momeneen, Lord of the Two Seas, Protector of the Holy Cities, and Defender of the Islamic Faith’. The caliph, bearer of even more titles than Queen Victoria, had just entered the twenty-fifth year of his reign. The Muslims of Natal wished to publicly ‘rejoice with the whole Mahomedan world in the advent of the auspicious and unique occasion’. They asked Gandhi to draft a letter conveying their congratulations and their hope that ‘Your Majesty [would] continue for many years to administer the sacred office of the Commander of the Faithful in health and peace, and may the faith of our Prophet (on whom be peace) thrive and be the solace of the millions of true believers is our earnest prayer to Allah-ul-malik.’49 The war of 1914–18 had placed Indian Muslims in an uncomfortable position. They were traditionally loyal to the British Raj, but they also venerated the caliph. Some Muslim leaders sided with the Turks. They included the brothers Shaukat and Mohammad Ali, both educated in Aligarh, both powerful orators and writers. The Ali Brothers were detained in 1915 and interned in the remote town of Chhindwara lest they sway Indian Muslims away from loyalty to the British Empire and in favour of the Ottoman Empire instead.  Gandhi had corresponded with the Ali Brothers, and was keen to meet them. He wrote several letters to the viceroy asking for permission to visit them in their internment home in Chhindwara, deep in the Central Provinces, but was denied each time.  Gandhi did, however, meet with another influential Muslim leader. This was Maulana Abdul Bari, the senior cleric of Firangi Mahal, a famous Lucknow seminary established in the seventeenth century.  Performing the hajj in 1910–11, Bari returned via Turkey, ‘entranced [by] the last vestige of Turkish greatness’. After the World War ended, he canvassed for the restoration of the Khilafat. 50 Gandhi and Abdul Bari first met in March 1918, at the home of a respected leader of the Congress, Dr M.A. Ansari. A year later, Gandhi visited Bari in Lucknow. They had long conversations, discussing Hindu–Muslim cooperation. Bari told Gandhi that a commission should be formed of ‘a few well-wishers of the motherland, Mussalmans and Hindu’. The commission would tour India and find out the reasons—economic, political, theological—which ‘initiate the disruption in the relation between the Mussalmans and the Hindus and should then think over the means of removing these reasons altogether. Means should be adopted which may place the Hindu–Moslem Unity on a stable foundation.’51 Gandhi was moved by Bari’s patriotism and concern for religious harmony. The maulana from Lucknow had told him that ‘Islam will fall to pieces if it ever takes and never gives’; he had even asked his followers to refrain from killing cows since the animal was sacred to their Hindu neighbours. In September 1919, Bari sent Gandhi a telegraph saying, ‘In celebration of Hindu– Muslim unity no cow sacrifices in Firangi Mahal this Bakrid’, to which Gandhi wired back,  ‘Delighted with your great act of renunciation. Pray, accept Id Mubarak.’52 That same month, a conference of Muslim leaders was held in Lucknow on the Khilafat question.  Gandhi now decided to lend his name to this movement. On 18 September, Gandhi told a predominantly Muslim meeting in Bombay that ‘you have the whole of the Hindus with you in this your just struggle’ (for the Turkish sultan to continue having control over Mecca and Medina). 53 Gandhi’s statement was a conceit. Why would the ordinary Hindu concern himself with an institution external to India, such as the Caliphate? Gandhi was acting here largely on his own, hoping it would lead to a wider unity between Hindus and Muslims.  Gandhi asked Muslims to make their case peacefully but firmly, and urged Hindus to support the demand of ‘their respected neighbours and brethren’. As he put it, ‘All those born in India have to live and die together. No community can rise at the cost of another, or preserve its rights if it permits those of others to be sacrificed.’54 On 17 October an All India Khilafat Day was observed, with prayers, fasting and hartals. Gandhi asked Hindus to participate out of solidarity, and ‘thus put a sacred seal on the Hindu–Mohammedan bond’. 55 Back in April, some Muslims had observed a hartal against the Rowlatt Act in response to Gandhi, a Hindu; now, some Hindus were showing sympathy with what was essentially a Muslim question.  The possibility of an entente between India’s two largest religious groupings alarmed the authorities.  Shortly after the successful observance of the Khilafat Day, the governor of Bombay wrote to a colleague that It is maddening to see all the Moslems gradually leaving us to make common cause with the Brahmans whom they despise and hate because they can get no sympathy from us: it is more than alarming to see the measured skill with which the Brahmans are exploiting the Moslem unrest in order to tear from us our hitherto never failing prop of Moslem loyalty and military support. 56 XII Through the first nine months of 1919, Gandhi maintained a ferocious pace: travelling, speaking, planning campaigns, supervising the ashram, mentoring his disciples. He had now acquired two new platforms— Young India and a Gujarati magazine called Navajivan. This was started by the socialist activist Indulal Yagnik, as a monthly. After Gandhi took over, it began to appear every week.  The two journals played different roles. Young India acted as a bridge between different parts of the country. Navajivan was specifically targeted at Gandhi’s own linguistic group. In his English newspaper, Gandhi wrote in measured tones, conveying news and providing context and analysis. In his own language he was more intimate: ‘In simple, easy Gujarati, he addressed the people directly, argued with them, coaxed and rebuked them as one of themselves.’57 By the end of September 1919, Navajivan had as many as 12,000 subscribers, each copy read by four or five people. Gandhi was ‘proud to think that I have numerous readers among farmers and workers’. Young India, however, had only 1200 subscribers and, now without advertisements, needed to double its subscription base to pay its way. Gandhi appealed to his ‘Tamil friends’ in particular to come forward and meet the shortfall. 58 Along with eager subscribers, Gandhi’s Gujarati newspaper was also attracting a large volume of unsolicited submissions. In an essay entitled ‘Request to Contributors’, Gandhi offered some suggestions to those who wished to have their work published in Navajivan. They were advised to write on one side of each sheet only (out of ‘pity for the editor and poor compositors’), to write ‘in a clear and beautiful hand’ (since ‘some are under the impression that any kind of handwriting is good enough in Gujarati’), and to revise, rewrite and shorten their drafts before submitting an essay for publication (although ‘even after all this, you will find the editor so merciless that he will have to cut out something else’). 59 An excess of contributors and contributions—this was a pleasant dilemma for an editor to have, and so soon after beginning publication.  XIII In October, the government finally allowed Gandhi to visit the Punjab. He left Ahmedabad on 22 October, reaching Lahore two days later. The crowd at the station to receive him was so large that it took Gandhi forty minutes to get from the platform to the car.  In Lahore, Gandhi was staying at the home of Saraladevi Chaudhurani. Born in 1872, the daughter of one of Rabindranath Tagore’s sisters, Saraladevi was a gifted singer and writer herself. She was also striking-looking, with a lush head of hair that hung down to her shoulders. She liked dressing up; pearls were among her favourite jewels. She was what Bengalis call a bhadramahila: a well-born, well-dressed, well-spoken lady.  The Tagore family held extremely progressive views on women, but even by their standards, Saraladevi was liberated and self-willed. Unlike other women of her class she was not content to make a good marriage and run a home. She took her first degree at the age of seventeen, in English literature. Then she studied physics, a subject in those days meant only for boys—she was the only girl in the class. Meanwhile, she pursued her interests in the creative arts. She was the first to set the great patriotic poem ‘ Vande Mataram’ to music. She also wrote stories and poems of her own in Bengali. Sarala was particularly close to her uncle Rabindranath; the two discussing, among other things, the respective merits of Browning, Keats and Shelley, and of South Indian and North Indian classical music. A composition of hers in praise of the motherland, ‘ Namo Hindustan’, was sung at the Calcutta Congress in December 1901.  Among those greatly impressed by Saraladevi was the charismatic and influential spiritual leader, Swami Vivekananda. He wanted her to join his movement, and make it better known in India and abroad. ‘If bold and talented women like yourself,’ wrote Vivekananda to Sarala, ‘go to England to preach, I am sure that every year hundreds of men and women will be blessed by adopting the religion of the land of Bharata.’60 Sarala did not join Vivekananda, instead moving south to Mysore to teach in a school, since (as she wrote) ‘to know oneself one must be away from the cloying atmosphere of one’s home’. After a spell in the south, she retraced her steps northwards, well beyond her native Bengal to the Kumaun hills.  She was planning a pilgrimage to Mansarovar in Tibet when she got a telegram saying her mother was at death’s door, and her last wish was to get Sarala married.  This was in 1905, when Sarala was already thirty-three. The groom chosen for her was a widower named Rambhuj Dutt Chaudhuri, who was a successful lawyer in Lahore. On moving to the Punjab, Saraladevi continued to write, sing and speak. In 1910 she founded a Bharat Stree Mahamandal (literally, the Great Circle of Indian Women), which aimed (in her words) to free them from ‘the shade of [the patriarchal lawmaker] Manu’ that had thus far kept Hindu women ‘under thraldom at every stage of their growth’.61 Sarala’s husband, Rambhuj, had been active in the anti-Rowlatt Act protests of 1919, and made many fiery speeches. These landed him in jail, so when Gandhi reached their home he was received by the wife alone.  Gandhi had briefly met Saraladevi in 1901, when she sang the opening song at the Calcutta Congress which he had attended. One does not know what impression she made then. But staying under her roof, with both their spouses absent, meant that they spoke long and often. In a ‘Punjab Letter’ for his Gujarati readers, Gandhi observed: In Lahore I am the guest of Smt. Sar[a]ladevi Choudhrani and have been bathing in her deep affection. I first met Sar[a]ladevi in 1901. She comes from the famous Tagore family. Of her learning and sincerity, too, I get evidence in ever so many ways. 62 The India of 1919 was conservative and deeply patriarchal. The women’s place was in the home, as Gandhi’s own wife Kasturba knew only too well. There were few women in India as variously gifted as Saraladevi, so active in so many public causes. And perhaps none so widely travelled. Those long conversations, possible only because the husband was away, left a profound impression on Gandhi.  He would be back for more.  After a week in Lahore, Gandhi left for Amritsar. With him was C.F. Andrews. The Englishman knew Amritsar well, but this was his friend’s first visit to the holy city of the Sikhs, the city where the massacre took place in April. To his Gujarati readers, Gandhi described his arrival thus: The entire area outside the station was packed with the citizens of Amritsar. Their cheers and shouts almost overwhelmed me. This huge procession proceeded towards the city. The people filled the car with flowers. I was taken to the mosque, which was thronged with Hindus and Muslims. With great difficulty I made my way from the mosque back to the car, and it was a long time before it reached the Golden Temple of the Sikhs. 63 Gandhi’s account of the spectacular reception he got is confirmed by a reporter on the spot. ‘Monday was a veritable Gandhi day for the whole of Amritsar,’ wrote the Bombay Chronicle, adding: Business houses and shops were decked with rich clothes and tapestries and every street and shop had laid its store of rose petals and garlands to shower on the distinguished guest of the city. Hours before the time, streams of humanity were moving to the railway station. Hindus, Mahommaddans and Sikhs had suspended business in honour of the event. In their determination to honour Mahatma Gandhi, women lined the roadsides, crowded windows and balconies and thousands of rupees worth [of] flowers were purchased and carried in cartfuls to the station and stocked en route. 64 It was, of course, not merely, in the Punjab that Gandhi now had admirers. The satyagraha against the Rowlatt Act made him an all-India figure, known in the major towns and cities of the subcontinent.  Yet, this might never have been the case had the acknowledged leader of Congress’s radical wing, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, been around when the movement started. Tilak was in London for almost all of 1919. When he returned to India in the last week of November, he told a public meeting that ‘he wished he had been in Bombay when Mr. Gandhi began satyagraha. He would have borne the difficulties with him and undergone the hardships.’65 This was both gracious and generous; for, Gandhi was Tilak’s junior in age as well as length of service to the national cause. Indeed, had Tilak been in India in early 1919 it might have been he, and not Gandhi, who would have led and directed the protests against the Rowlatt Act.  XIV The government had set up a committee to inquire into the Punjab disturbances. Chaired by Lord Hunter, a former solicitor general of Scotland, it had seven other members—four British and three Indian. Meanwhile, the Congress set up an inquiry committee of its own, with five members, among them Gandhi and the Allahabad lawyer Motilal Nehru.  Through most of November and December, Gandhi travelled through the Punjab countryside, taking statements from people about martial law, the Jallianwala firing and other instances of state repression. He stayed on in the Punjab until the end of 1919, so as to attend the annual Congress meeting. This year it was being held, for both symbolic and political reasons, in Amritsar. The stars of the show were the Ali Brothers, who had recently been released as part of a general amnesty. They arrived in Amritsar ‘amid cheers, tears, embraces, and a veritable mountain of garlands’. The highlight of the Congress session was ‘an impromptu oration by Mohammad Ali, during which he proclaimed that he and all the other released leaders would rather return to prison indefinitely than see India in chains’.66 Gandhi, for his part, struck a more conciliatory note. After Tilak and the Bengal leader C.R. Das had characterized the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms as ‘disappointing’, Gandhi argued that ‘these reforms can be used as a stepping-stone to full responsible government’. Besides, ‘Indian culture demands that we shall trust the man who extends the hand of fellowship. The King-Emperor has extended the hand of fellowship.’ Therefore, the Congress should offer cooperation under such conditions as it may see fit to lay down. Gandhi went on to say: If I get a sour loaf, I reject it; I do not take it. But if I get a loaf which is not enough or which does not contain sufficient condiments in it, I shall see to it that I get condiments too at a later stage, but I take a bite; then it is not disappointing. 67 The metaphor that Gandhi used was much favoured by his one-time mentor, the English vegetarian Henry Salt, who likewise believed that ‘improvements never come in the mass, but always by instalment; and it is only reactionaries who deny that half a loaf is better than no bread’. 68 Gandhi was at this stage both an incrementalist and an Empire loyalist. His faith in British justice was shaken but not broken. Perhaps the Hunter Committee would properly punish those responsible for the Punjab atrocities; perhaps the Rowlatt Act would be withdrawn; perhaps the Caliphate, so important to Indian Muslims, would be safeguarded. So long as these possibilities existed, the Congress could, he felt, work with the government in a spirit of constructive cooperation.  CHAPTER FIVE The Personal and the Political I In South Africa, Gandhi’s first struggles against racial discrimination had largely been funded and staffed by Muslims. In the diaspora such trans-religious solidarity was easier, since Hindus, Muslims, Christians and Parsis from India all faced the same disabilities. In the homeland, however, the different communities were established in their particular ways of life. To build a joint Hindu– Muslim union against colonial rule was more difficult, not least because the British were adept at playing off one community against another. But, for a movement to count as truly ‘national’, it could not be restricted to Hindus alone. Hence, Gandhi’s efforts to reach out to Muslims, first by supporting the restoration of the Caliphate, and now by canvassing the support of the Ali Brothers. Since they were ‘the eyes of the Muslims’, Gandhi hoped that by befriending them he could cement Hindu– Muslim unity. 1 Gandhi believed that personal relationships were a reliable route to intercommunity cooperation.  His closest friends in the diaspora included a Parsi merchant and a Muslim merchant, both Gujarati-speaking like himself, both willing to repeatedly court arrest under his leadership; two Jews—an architect and a journalist-turned-lawyer; and a Christian priest who was also his first biographer.  Now, in India, men such as the Ali Brothers and Maulana Abdul Bari were to be both his personal friends as well as his political comrades. Gandhi thought that if individuals of different religions could inspire trust and affection among one another, surely the wider communities of which they were part of could do likewise.  In January 1920, Gandhi proceeded to Lahore, continuing his investigations into the Punjab atrocities, and incidentally also furthering his friendship with Saraladevi Chaudhurani. The day he reached Lahore, Gandhi wrote to his nephew Maganlal that ‘Saraladevi has been showering her love on me in every possible way’. In return, Gandhi hoped to convert her to his ways. He asked Maganlal to send a good spinning instructor for Saraladevi. 2 In the last week of January, Sarala’s husband was released from prison. The day he came home, Gandhi ‘saw a new glow on Smt. Saraladevi’s face. The face which had been lined with care was today bright with joy. Or perhaps I am doing her an injustice. Even during separation Saraladevi had not lost the light on her face.’3 In his first two weeks in the Punjab, Gandhi visited Gujrat, Sargodha and other districts in the interior. ‘Saraladevi Chowdhrani accompanied me on this journey,’ wrote Gandhi, but it is not clear whether her husband did. The peasants of Punjab were much taken with the lady, for, as her companion noted, ‘many men and women address Saraladevi as Mataji or Mother’. 4 Gandhi and his associates had now recorded the testimonies of some 1700 witnesses to the happenings of March–April 1919. With this mountain of material, he proceeded, alone, to Banaras, where he stayed in Madan Mohan Malaviya’s house and hammered out a first draft of the Congress report on the Punjab. Taking a walk at sunrise, he saw a ‘golden sheen appear on the Ganga’, and as the sun came into view over the horizon, ‘there seemed to stand in the water of the river a great pillar of gold’. This beautiful sight was soon spoilt by another, that of people defecating on the banks of the river. One could not walk along the Ganga barefoot, one dare not drink its water, and one could not visit with pleasure the still dirt-and-garbage-filled Kashi Vishwanath Temple either. When he started his morning walk Gandhi was moved to sing the gayatri hymn (an invocation to the sun); by the time he ended, he was reflecting gloomily on ‘the cause of [the] degradation of the Hindus’. 5 The report drafted, Gandhi took the night train from Banaras to Delhi, where he was once again joined by Saraladevi (coming from Lahore), the two travelling together to Ahmedabad. One does not know what Kasturba made of the new arrival. On 27 February, Sarala was the main speaker at a public meeting held in the dry riverbed of the Sabarmati River. A crowd of 3000 heard her speak on the Punjab troubles, her words translated from Hindi into Gujarati by her companion. Speaking after her, Gandhi said that ‘unless our sisters in the country give their blessings to the brothers, India’s progress is impossible’. In Ahmedabad he had found a sister in Anasuya Sarabhai, and now, in the Punjab, he had found Saraladevi. When he stayed with her, said Gandhi, ‘I had from her as much service as from one’s own sister and thus became her debtor.’6 Gandhi was enchanted with, and by, Saraladevi Chaudhurani. A sign of this was the regularity with which her name appeared in the columns of his newspaper. In February 1920, Young India reprinted several letters connected with Saraladevi’s membership of the ‘Lahore Purdah Club’, a society which brought together high-born Indian women and wives of senior British officials. In April 1919, the president of the club was Una O’Dwyer, wife of the province’s lieutenant governor. After Sarala’s husband had been arrested for his part in the Rowlatt satyagraha, the president wrote to the Purdah Club’s managing committee, demanding that they ask ‘the Chaudhurani’ to resign her membership, failing which she would be removed from the list of members. ‘It is obvious,’ said Lady O’Dwyer,  ‘that the wife of the Lieutenant Governor cannot belong to the same club as the wife of Chaudhari Ram Bhuj.’ Young India printed Mrs O’Dwyer’s letter, along with a letter from the secretary of the Purdah Club, asking Saraladevi to resign. This had the signatures of all the committee members, several of whom were Indian. In reproducing this correspondence, Gandhi’s newspaper remarked: ‘It is painful to find cultured Indian ladies being so terror-struck as to easily expose themselves to ridicule and insult. For in sending the notice they did to Saraladevi Chaudhurani they insulted not Mrs Chaudhari but themselves. Shrimati Saraladevi is a member of the Bengali aristocracy, wife of a noted leader of the Punjab and what is more, one of the few highly educated and gifted ladies India possesses. It was the Club that was honoured by her being its member.’7 The treatment by the Lahore Purdah Club of Saraladevi was unquestionably petty. But did it merit extended commentary in the main organ of Gandhi’s political struggle? That an individual’s club membership was treated alongside serious articles on education and the condition of workers must be reckoned an example of the editor’s extreme partiality to this subject.  The next month, Young India printed an article by Saraladevi on how the Punjab was awoken from its slumber by an unnamed man from Gujarat. ‘He had never seen the Punjab but he had a message for her as for the rest of India. Many read it, some only understood it. . . . The people of the Punjab did not sign his pledge. They did not grasp the inwardness of Satyagraha, nevertheless its freedom-giving spirit permeated the Punjab air and the Punjab was vitalised. A new power came into being—the power of suffering—and so the citizens of Lahore received bullets in their breasts without retaliating . . .’8 A second article by Saraladevi praised Gandhi by name, for having, in his ashram school,  ‘reproduce[d] all the best of our ancient Gurukuls’. A third referred to him as ‘the national visionary who is blessed with prevision through the lens of a lofty mission’. 9 This was a mutual admiration society, and a very public one too.  II Gandhi was becoming increasingly engaged with the Khilafat question. The 19th of March 1920 was to be observed as ‘Khilafat Day’, with fasting and cessation of business. In a letter to the press, Gandhi summarized the Muslim claim as follows: the Turkish Empire should be fully restored in the European parts it once controlled, subject to protection of the rights of non-Muslim subjects; and the sultan should be assured control over the holy places of Islam in Arabia, although the Arabs could be granted self-governing rights. ‘To deprive the Khalif [Caliph] of the suzerainty of Arabia,’ wrote Gandhi, ‘is to reduce the Khilafat to a nullity.’10 Muslim leaders had made several unsuccessful representations to the viceroy. The victorious Allies had not forgiven Turkey for siding with Germany. They also claimed that the Ottomans had grossly oppressed the Arabs. To free the Arabs from Turkish control, and to bring them under their own influence, the British and the French were in the process of elevating tribal chiefs into full-fledged monarchs, by creating kingdoms in Jordan, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia. If this happened, Turkey would shrink to a fraction of the size it enjoyed under the Ottomans; crucially, it would lose control of the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.  The attitude of the Allies put a great strain on Gandhi’s Empire loyalty. Back in December, at the Congress session in Amritsar, Gandhi had suggested that the party work with the government in making the Montagu–Chelmsford Reforms effective. But he was now arguing that, with the refusal of the Allies to grant the Turkish claim, ‘non-co-operation is therefore the only remedy left open for us’.  A fresh satyagraha might make the government reconsider. Gandhi thus asked: ‘If every Hindu and every Muslim resigns from the service of the Government, what will be the result?’11 In pursuit of their case, a ‘Khilafat Delegation’ was sent to England in March 1920. It was led by the respected Delhi doctor M.A. Ansari, a friend of Gandhi’s. Its most prominent member was Mohammad Ali, who addressed a series of public meetings in London. Islam, he told the British public, ‘does not recognise geographical and racial barriers such as the nationalism of modern Europe has set up in the way of the freest human intercourse and the widest human sympathies’. Thus,  ‘to the Muslim of India the Turk is not only a man, but a brother’ with whom he shared ‘a common outlook on life and common institutions and laws’. And Islam was ‘a complete scheme of life’, which had two centres, ‘the personal centre’ of the caliph and ‘the local centre’ of Mecca and Medina. The two centres were connected, which was why it was vital that the holy places of Arabia be under the control of the caliph. Mohammad Ali hoped for a loose federation of Turk and Arab that would keep the caliphate intact and which ‘will give the Arab all the freedom he desires or demands’. 12 The Khilafat Delegation made speeches, and met with MPs, Cabinet ministers and the prime minister, Lloyd George. Their efforts were unsuccessful. In the first week of May, the Allies formally announced the peace terms that Turkey was compelled to accept. Turkey was granted the Constantinople sector and the Turkish areas of Asia Minor. However, Syria, Mesopotamia and Palestine were to become quasi-independent states, the first under a French Mandate, the latter two under a British Mandate. Hejaz (part of present-day Saudi Arabia) was to be recognized as ‘a free and independent State’, with its ruler to control access to Mecca and Medina for pilgrims from other countries. 13 The Khilafat Delegation was devastated. So was their friend Gandhi, who claimed that this offer broke a ‘solemn promise’ made to the Turks by Prime Minister Lloyd George. He called for direct action in response. ‘If India—both Hindu and Mohammedan—can act as one man and can withdraw her partnership in this crime against humanity which the peace terms represent, she will soon secure a revision of the treaty and give herself and the Empire at least, if not the world, a lasting peace. There is no doubt that the struggle would be bitter, sharp and possibly prolonged, but it is worth all the sacrifice that it is likely to call forth.’14 From its inception in 1885, the Indian National Congress had a mixed record in attracting Muslims to its ranks. The formation of the Muslim League in 1906 and the creation of separate electorates had further muddied the waters. The League and the Congress were initially suspicious of one another, until Jinnah and Tilak brought them together in Lucknow in 1916.  The Rowlatt satyagraha of April 1919 had seen Hindus and Muslims come together on a common platform. In taking up the Khilafat question, Gandhi was hoping to consolidate this unity. He had already befriended the Ali Brothers and Maulana Abdul Bari. More recently, he had got to know Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, a respected scholar and journalist who was now increasingly active in the Khilafat movement.  Not all prominent Muslims were in favour of the restoration of the Khalifa, however. Muhammad Ali Jinnah, for one, had mixed feelings. As a Shia, he did not share the Sunni reverence for the Caliphate. As a constitutionalist, he was not in favour of street protests demanding its restoration.15 And was Khilafat the best way to promote inter-religious solidarity? C.F. Andrews was unsure.  The Khilafatists in India, wrote Andrews to Gandhi, were too ‘pro-Turkish’ and ‘have lamentably failed to understand the awakening of the Arab speaking people’. They were asking for the Turkish caliphate to once more have dominion over non-Turkish territories such as Syria, Palestine, Arabia,  Armenia and Mesopotamia. But, as Andrews pointed out, ‘these lands have been won by the sword and lost by the sword. They have never been populated by Turks.’16 Many Hindus also did not agree with Gandhi on the Khilafat question. The historian Jadunath Sarkar argued that the idea that the ruler of Turkey was the spiritual head of all Muslims did not have the antiquity Gandhi accorded it. Rather, it was a creation of the late nineteenth century; a response to the absorption of other sovereign Muslim states into Western empires. The liberal editor K. Natarajan accepted that the Turks had been treated harshly by the Allies; but, as he pointed out, with the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire, ‘the Indian Mussulman’s freedom to follow his religious tenets has not suffered a bit’.17 Hindu intellectuals worried about Gandhi’s enchantment with Khilafat; so did the Hindu orthodoxy.  If they made common cause with the Muslims, would they have to eat together (breaking the rules of caste) and perhaps even sanction inter-religious marriages? Gandhi assuaged their fears, saying that ‘in order that we may help them on the Khilafat issue, there is absolutely no need to drink water from the same glass, sit together at meals or give sons and daughters in marriage’. He offered his own personal experience as proof. When he stayed with Maulana Abdul Bari in Lucknow, the maulana ‘sent for a Brahmin cook for me and even had his milk warmed by him. He is a non-vegetarian but he did not let me catch even a glimpse of meat in his house. Because of his observing such decorum, our friendship was strengthened, not weakened.’18 Finally, to modernist and orthodox Hindu alike, Gandhi offered an instrumental argument: ‘If twenty-two crores of Hindus intelligently plead for the Muslims on the Khilafat issue, I believe that they would for ever win the vote of the eight crores of Muslims.’ Meanwhile, the Congress and the government had released their respective reports on the Punjab troubles. The Congress report, drafted by Gandhi, recommended that both General Dyer, the butcher of Amritsar, and the lieutenant governor at the time, Sir Michael O’Dwyer, be relieved from ‘any responsible office under the Crown’. It also called for the recall of the viceroy, the refund of fines collected from the people, and an end to the corrupt practices of local officials. 19 The official report acknowledged the excesses under martial law, and chastised General Dyer for not thinking before he acted. However, it shied away from punishing errant officials. The viceroy, forwarding the report to London, euphemized Dyer’s action, saying, ‘in the face of a great crisis an officer may be thrown temporarily off the balance of his judgement’. He also gave the much-hated Michael O’Dwyer a resounding certificate of character, praising his ‘experience and courage’ as well as his ‘decision and vigour’, which, in the viceroy’s view, ‘was largely responsible for quelling a dangerous rising which might have had widespread and disastrous effects on the rest of India’.20 To the rejection of the Khilafat demand was now added the whitewashing of the egregious behaviour of the Punjab government. This was a double betrayal, putting enormous strain on Gandhi’s once fervent faith in British justice. He now decided that the only way to make the rulers see reason was to launch a fresh movement of protest. He outlined in print a programme of ‘non-co-operation’, to unfold in four stages. The first entailed the giving up of titles; the second the resignation from government service of select officials; the third stage—a ‘distant goal’—the resignation of policemen and soldiers; the fourth stage, ‘still more remote’, the non-payment of taxes. He added that ‘non-cooperation as a voluntary movement can only succeed if the feeling is genuine and strong enough to make people suffer to the utmost’.21 III Even as he thought and wrote about political matters, Gandhi’s relationship with Saraladevi steadily grew more intimate. He persuaded her to write an article for Navajivan; introducing it in print, he asked readers to read it several times over since ‘its sweetness is inexhaustible’. 22 In April, Sarala travelled with him to Bombay, where he had to attend a Khilafat meeting—6 to 13 April was observed as ‘National Week’, since, exactly a year ago, the Rowlatt Act hartal had occurred on the 6th and the Jallianwala Bagh shooting on the 13th. Gandhi spoke at several meetings, Sarala each time accompanying him to the venue. Afterwards, he penned this endearing (and extended) tribute to his companion: The swadeshi movement received the finest impetus from Shrimati Saraladevi Chowdhrani. During the National Week, she expressed a desire to wear a sari and blouse of khadi [homespun cloth]. I have not so far succeeded in inducing any woman to wear a sari made of khadi and so at first I thought Saraladevi was joking. But she was perfectly sincere in what she said and, what is more, she meant khadi as rough as what I wear. I got a sari and blouse made for her and she celebrated the National Week in these. When her maternal uncle [Tagore, also in Bombay at the time] saw her in this dress, he also remarked: ‘If you don’t feel embarrassed yourself, there is nothing wrong with this dress. You can go anywhere in it.’ There was a big party on the 11th at Mrs.  Petit’s in honour of the poet [Tagore] and she had to decide whether she could attend it in khadi. She then remembered the poet’s remark and honoured that party by attending it in this same khadi dress. She received no less respect than she used to in her costly silk saris. After this she went to all meetings and functions in khadi and at every one of them which I attended I could see that people’s respect for her had increased because of this dress. 23 However, Gandhi’s other ‘sister’, Anasuya Sarabhai, had steadfastly refused to wear khadi. As she later recalled: ‘The first person to wear khadi was Saraladevi Chaudharani. She chose the thickest cloth with an enormous border—the one used for curtains.’ Gandhi kept trying to get Anasuya herself to wear khadi, but she always refused, saying, ‘you keep sending me khadi, but I find it so thick’.24 From Bombay, Saraladevi proceeded to Lahore to arrange the marriage of her stepson, Jagdish (the child of her husband by his first wife), while Gandhi returned to Kasturba and the ashram in Ahmedabad. Then he proceeded, via Bombay, for a five-day retreat in the fort of Sinhagad, close to Poona. His pleurisy had recurred, with pain in his chest and legs, and his doctor had advised a period of rest in the hills.  From Sinhagad, Gandhi wrote to Saraladevi every day. A letter posted on 30 April began: I have just got up with two dreams, one about you and [the] other about Khilafat. To my great joy, you returned within two days. I asked, ‘How so quickly?’ You replied, ‘Oh it was Panditji’s [her husband] trick to have me by him. Jagdish’s marriage is as far off as ever. I have therefore returned.’ I discovered that it was a dream. I fell off again to sleep in disgust . . . 25 The next day, Gandhi wrote again. He had ‘a most torturing headache’ the previous night, and his leg still ached. Then he continued: ‘I ask you however not to worry about me. I thought you should know my condition, if only to keep you to the fortnight’s limit if Jagdish’s marriage is then over or if it is postponed. If you would persuade Panditji too to come so much the better. He must see and live the Ashram life.’ Despite the prefatory ‘I ask you not to worry about me . . .’ the letter is redolent of emotional blackmail. He seems to have extracted a promise from Sarala that she would return from Lahore in a fortnight; he would hold her to it, even if it meant parading his physical (and mental) pain.  This second letter from Sinhagad ended with a very telling paragraph: And now for a boon. I know you have granted many. The appetite has grown with the receiving. You said you were shy over working at the Ashram. Will you not get rid of your shyness by commencing household work there? . . . Great and good though you are, you are not a complete woman without achieving the ability to do household work. You have preached it to others. Your preaching will be more effective when people know that even at your time of life and in your station you do not mind doing it.26 Gandhi wanted Sarala near him, for her charm and her conversation. But he also wanted to mould her in his image. In her own home, Sarala would have left housework to the servants, leaving her free to paint, write, sing and converse. Gandhi wanted her words and her songs, but he also wished to make her a model ashramite who cooked, cleaned and span too.  On 2 May, Gandhi wrote his third letter to Sarala in as many days. He was missing her terribly. He wrote: You still continue to haunt me even in my sleep. No wonder Panditji calls you the greatest shakti of India. You may have cast that spell over him. You are performing the trick over me now.  Gandhi continued: I was certain of a letter from you yesterday. But none came. Today too there is a blank. I wonder, however. I know you have not failed me. It is the wretched post. 27 We owe the existence of these letters to Mahadev Desai, who noted them in his diary, from where they finally found their way to the Collected Works. Almost all of Sarala’s own letters to Gandhi were destroyed by Gandhi’s family. But even from one side of the correspondence we can see how intimate the friendship was.  Gandhi was besotted by his new friend, and she, most certainly, by him. Sarala was loyal to her husband—but he was no Mahatma, merely a minor provincial leader rather than a major national leader. Gandhi was loyal to Kasturba—but she was merely a homemaker, no poet, singer or political activist.  The relationship was intense, but not equal. Gandhi had taken to signing his letters ‘Law Giver’, a self-regarding appellation that reveals his desire to have Sarala conform to his ways, to modify or change her lifestyle so that it might more closely approximate his own. The aristocratic bhadramahila would, under his close and direct supervision, become a simple servant of the nation.  IV In the India in which Gandhi was born and raised, friendship between boys and girls, men and women, was impermissible. Education was strictly segregated. Working-class and peasant women ventured out alone into factory, field or street; but middle-class women did not. Apart from his wife, the only women an Indian man of Gandhi’s generation and class would have had any intimacy with were his mother, sisters, daughters, grandmothers, aunts, nieces and (at a stretch) servants.  By living outside India, Gandhi had been able to free himself from custom and convention, and forge friendships across the gender divide. In his years in the diaspora he was close to three women in particular: his long-time secretary in South Africa, Sonja Schlesin; Henry Polak’s wife, Millie, since the Polaks and the Gandhis shared a home in Johannesburg; and Polak’s sister, Maud, whom he had met in London.  Maud Polak was in love with Gandhi—this was not reciprocated. With Millie and Sonja the friendship was entirely platonic. He liked and respected them—indeed, they were among the few colleagues who dared challenge or criticize him.  Saraladevi was Gandhi’s first woman friend in India, and also his first Indian woman friend. Their relationship was shot through with passion and romance. He found her stimulating, interesting, even glamorous. He was possessive about her, he wished to be with her as much as possible.  The relationship between Gandhi and Saraladevi was never consummated sexually. But it seems it came very close to doing so. Years later, in an exchange with a Gujarati colleague about the merits of brahmacharya, Gandhi remarked: ‘I myself am a proof before you that sex does not discriminate between the young and the old. Even today I have to erect all sorts of walls around me for the sake of safety.’ Then he continued: ‘Despite this, I was in danger of succumbing a few years ago.’28 Notably, Gandhi wished to share the intensity of his feelings for Saraladevi with his closest male friends. Some months after he first met Saraladevi, Gandhi was finally able to discover the whereabouts of his old Johannesburg companion Hermann Kallenbach. He had, he told Kallenbach, got his address ‘after the greatest search’. He had feared that Kallenbach was dead. ‘How I wish I could go over to see you and hug you,’ he wrote.  The friends had not been in contact for five years—since Kallenbach had been denied permission to come to India. Gandhi filled him in on the news. ‘Dev[a]das is with me, ever growing in every way and in every direction. Mrs. Gandhi is at [the] Ashram. She has aged considerably but is as brave as ever. She is the same woman you know with her faults and virtues. Manilal and Ramdas are at Phoenix looking after Indian Opinion. Harilal is at Calcutta doing his business.’ Gandhi mentioned that he was ‘engaged in a fierce struggle with the Government’. He told Kallenbach that ‘my life is simpler than ever. My food is not now fruit and nuts. I am living on goat’s milk and bread and raisins.’ Amidst the news, familial and dietary, Gandhi did not fail to tell Kallenbach about his newest friend: ‘I have come in close touch with a lady who often travels with me. Our relationship is indefinable. I call her my spiritual wife. A friend has called it an intellectual wedding. I want you to see her. It was under her roof that I passed several months at Lahore in the Punjab.’29 The friend who had called it ‘an intellectual wedding’ was almost certainly Mahadev Desai, who had transcribed Gandhi’s letters, opened Saraladevi’s letters, and been somewhere in the background in Ahmedabad, Bombay, Lahore, Sinhagad and all the other places Gandhi went with or without his new companion.  Apart from Kallenbach, Gandhi had also written about his new friend to his Tamil protégé C.  Rajagopalachari (popularly known as Rajaji). Gandhi’s letter has been lost, but we do have fragments of Rajaji’s reply. Where Mahadev was approving of, or at least acquiescent in, the development of the relationship, Rajaji was dismayed. In his letter, Gandhi seems to have suggested that Sarala and he were thinking of taking the friendship a step further. What this was is not clear—perhaps a public proclamation of their ‘spiritual marriage’? Rajaji wrote back that this would bring ‘unutterable shame and ruin’ to Gandhi, and destroy ‘all saintliness, all purity, all asceticism, all India’s hope’.  That Gandhi had even contemplated such a step filled his protégé with horror. ‘How could you venture out,’ wrote Rajaji agitatedly, ‘when in your boat was the faith and fate of millions of simple souls who if the boat had capsized would have seen neither beauty nor love nor grandeur, but unspeakable shame and death.’ Rajaji had met Saraladevi briefly, and been unimpressed. ‘I fail to see any “greatness” in the lady,’ he wrote to Gandhi. ‘She is like a hundred other women, whom a little education makes very attractive. I have seen scores of bigger-minded [and] better-souled women.’ Rajaji thought Saraladevi was ‘not worthy to unloose the latchet of Miss Faring [a Danish missionary who admired Gandhi and joined the ashram] and as to Mrs Gandhi, it would be like comparing a kerosene oil Ditmar lamp to the morning sun . . .’ Rajaji chastised Gandhi, but blamed Saraladevi too. ‘It is difficult to forgive her reckless indifference to consequences,’ he remarked. He advised Gandhi to ‘pray disengage yourself at once completely: No delay is allowable when you hold such great trusts’ (namely, the fate of the nation itself). 30 This was a brave and necessary letter: brave because few of Gandhi’s Indian admirers ever criticized him directly; necessary because Gandhi does not seem to have recognized the enormous risks of the step he was contemplating. Gandhi’s asceticism was a vital part of his mass appeal.  Although polygamy was allowed under Hindu law, Hindu myths and Hindu social custom were both strongly in favour of monogamous marriages. Had Gandhi publicly taken another wife, albeit even a ‘spiritual’ one, it might have massively eroded his standing among his fellow Hindus, endangering the wider movement for political and social change that he was leading.  Gandhi was taken aback by Rajaji’s forthrightness, and he did heed his advice—in part. He would not publicly take Saraladevi as his spiritual wife, but he would not—or not yet—disengage from her completely.  V In the first week of June 1920, the Khilafat Committee met with major Congress leaders in Allahabad.  The meeting began with Motilal Nehru and Madan Mohan Malaviya saying that they would wait and watch for some time before committing themselves to a policy of non-cooperation with the government. At this Shaukat Ali said angrily that ‘they had already enough time to make up their minds’. Maulana Abdul Bari was equally upset; the Khilafat, he said, was ‘a matter in which the very life of the Mussalmans was at stake and still the Hindus thought it proper to play with it’.  Gandhi now stepped in to calm tempers. He had, he reminded Bari and Shaukat Ali, pledged his own support to the Khilafat movement, but they must, in return, commit themselves to non-violence.  He then outlined his four-stage approach to non-cooperation. It was decided that a decision as to whether to implement these stages would be taken at a special session of the Congress, to be held in Calcutta in September.  Saraladevi Chaudhurani attended this meeting in Allahabad, although she does not appear to have spoken. Another silent participant was a mole of the intelligence department. He later reported that the striking feature of the meeting was ‘Gandhi’s astounding assumption of dictatorship’, and the Muslim leaders’ acquiescence in it. Shaukat Ali said ‘the Mahomedans were quite prepared to leave themselves under the guidance of Gandhi’.31 In the third week of June, Gandhi wrote a long letter to the viceroy on Khilafat. ‘The whole of Mussalman India’, he said, had ‘behaved in a singularly restrained manner during the past five years’.  The reward for their loyalty and restraint was a ‘cruel’ settlement imposed on Turkey by the Allies.  Indian Muslims now had three alternatives: violence, emigration and non-cooperation, with the last being the ‘only dignified and constitutional’ option. ‘But there is yet an escape from non-cooperation,’ said Gandhi—the viceroy could identify with the Indian Muslims and pressure London to revise the settlement.32 In July, Gandhi toured the Punjab and Sindh, speaking on the importance of non-cooperation. If the programme was implemented, it would consist of the renouncing of titles, the boycotting of legislatures, the withdrawal of children from government schools, the giving up of practice by lawyers, and the refusal of invitations to all government functions. Gandhi expressed his ‘firm belief’ that the British could be made to yield under the pressure of a non-violent struggle. For, ‘no European nation is more amenable to the pressure of moral force than the British’. 33 The 1st of August was to be observed as Khilafat Day. Gandhi wished to be in Bombay to lead the hartal there. He returned to Ahmedabad from Sindh on 26 July, spent two days in the ashram, and on the 28th, took the night train to Bombay. He spent the morning in preparatory meetings. In the afternoon he heard that Bal Gangadhar Tilak was seriously ill, having just suffered two heart attacks.  When Gandhi reached the home where Tilak was staying, a massive crowd had collected. Gandhi made his way into the house to see the patient. Tilak was delirious, so no words were exchanged. 34 Tilak died in the early hours of 1 August. The news spread through the city, bringing thousands to the home where he lay. People of all ages and from all communities came to pay their respects. A dense ‘mass of humanity’ accompanied the body to the cremation grounds. 35 In the vanguard of this crowd of worshippers was Gandhi. He acted as one of the pall-bearers.  Later, at the Khilafat meeting scheduled for that day, rich tributes were paid to Tilak by Hindu and Muslim leaders. The main speech was made by Gandhi, who stressed the renouncing of posts and titles, non-violence in word and deed, and ‘a vigorous prosecution of swadeshi’. 36 On the same day, Gandhi wrote to the viceroy returning the three medals the king-emperor had awarded him, for services rendered in the Boer, Zulu and World Wars. ‘Valuable as these honours have been to me,’ said Gandhi, ‘I cannot wear them with an easy conscience so long as my Mussulman countrymen have to labour under a wrong done to their religious sentiments.’37 That Gandhi returned the medals on the day Tilak died was a striking coincidence. For, of all the Congress leaders of the previous generation, Tilak was the most uncompromising in his opposition to colonial rule. Swaraj was his birthright and he would have it. By being in Bombay on the day Tilak died, and helping carry his body to the bier, Gandhi had further signalled that he would inherit the mantle of the departed leader. If Gokhale’s death in 1915 freed Gandhi from the confines of social service, Tilak’s death in 1920 allowed Gandhi to emerge as the leader of the militant tendency in the Congress-led national movement.  CHAPTER SIX Capturing the Congress I Gandhi’s growing militancy through the first half of 1920 alarmed the British authorities. There had been questions in Parliament about his threatened programme of non-cooperation. Conservative MPs, as well as the Conservative press, were pressing the secretary of state and the viceroy to arrest him.  In July 1920, Montagu had hinted in the House of Commons that if non-cooperation was carried out, Gandhi would be arrested. Gandhi immediately wrote an article in response to Montagu’s threat.  He listed three aims the government might have in arresting him: 1. ‘To frighten me into changing my views.  2. To separate me from the people and thus weaken public opinion.  3. By removing me from their midst, to test the people and see whether they are really agitated over the subject.’ If he was indeed arrested, Gandhi hoped that ‘the people will go ahead with non-co-operation with still greater vigour’.1 On 4 August, Chelmsford wrote to Montagu that they did not intend to arrest the chief troublemaker, since ‘once you have made a martyr you do not know where his martyrdom may land you’. Besides, the viceroy was confident that the programme of non-cooperation would be ‘a fiasco, since it runs counter to the common sense of the community at large’. If the leader’s campaign was going to fizzle out anyway, why bother to arrest him? 2 II Gandhi spent most of August in the Madras Presidency, speaking on non-cooperation. He started his tour in Madras city, with a speech to a massive crowd assembled on the beach opposite Presidency College.  Gandhi began by speaking of his ‘boundless faith’ in the Tamil people, whom he had known since 1893. He then answered the question on people’s minds: ‘What is this non-co-operation about which you have heard much, and why do we want to offer this non-co-operation?’ The two key issues were Khilafat and the Punjab. On the first, Gandhi believed the Hindus must ‘perform a neighbourly duty’, since ‘they have an opportunity of a lifetime which will not occur for another hundred years, to show their goodwill, fellowship and friendship and to prove what they have been saying for all these long years that the Mussulman is the brother of the Hindu’. On the second, he insisted that ‘the Punjab has wounded the heart of India as no other question has for the past century. I do not exclude from my calculation the Mutiny of 1857.’3 During his tour, Gandhi was joined by Shaukat Ali. The two addressed meetings in Kumbakonam, Nagore, Madurai, Trichy, Calicut, Kasargod and Mangalore, speaking to mixed audiences of Hindus and Muslims, often with women also present. For most of their journey, they were accompanied by C.  Rajagopalachari, who translated their speeches into Tamil.  Gandhi and Shaukat Ali presented a striking contrast. The Muslim dressed stylishly, in a great green cloak and a cap with a crescent on it. And he had a booming voice. Gandhi was clothed more modestly, in a homespun dhoti, and shirt, and spoke softly. 4 Yet the travelling companions got on famously. Their joint tour in the Madras Presidency, Gandhi told C.F. Andrews, ‘has confirmed . . .  my belief in the greatness and goodness of Shaukat Ali. He is really one of the most sincere of men I have met. He is generous, frank, brave and gentle.’5 Admittedly, they had differing views on violence. Unlike Gandhi, Shaukat Ali ‘believes one can kill an enemy and, for doing so, even deceit can be employed’. But for the present, Ali had accepted Gandhi’s methods: ‘He tells the people frankly that, at the present time, my way is the best for them.’6 During his tour of Madras, Saraladevi wrote several letters to Gandhi. A bare but most intriguing summary of their contents is provided by Mahadev Desai. Here is his diary entry for 23 August 1920: Bezwada. Seven or eight letters were received from Saraladevi during the Madras tour. They indicate her suspicion about . . . her charge that Bapu is dazzled by him and her complaint that Bapu’s letters betray ‘mental exhaustion’. She says that for Bapu’s sake she made such an inordinate sacrifice. She put in one pan all the joys of life and pleasures of the world and in the other ‘Bapu and his laws’ and committed the folly of choosing the latter! 7 The person denoted by those ellipses was almost certainly Shaukat Ali. Sarala was unhappy with Gandhi’s enchantment with him; whether out of possessiveness or reservations regarding Khilafat we cannot say. And Sarala was clearly tired of being told what to wear, what to eat, how to cook and clean. She was not an ashramite who had voluntarily taken a series of vows—asked by Gandhi to live like one, she was resisting.  Like many lawgivers, Gandhi failed to see the signs of rebellion. In one of her letters, Sarala had said she wished to visit her family in Calcutta. Gandhi, writing from Bezwada on 23 August (the same day as Mahadev’s diary entry above) told her to do so only ‘after you have perfected your spinning-wheel and Hindi and put our Lahore work on a sound footing’. The next day, he wrote again: ‘Your letters have caused me distress. You do not like my sermons. . . . I do not at all like your doubting the necessity of the life adopted by you or the life you are trying to adopt. . . . If I am your Law-giver and if I do not always lay down the law, surely I must at least reason with you on things of eternity or supreme importance for the country for which we live and which we love so well.’8 III Gandhi had taken his message of non-cooperation to the Punjab, Sindh and the United Provinces; to Bombay and Ahmedabad; to the large and small towns of the Madras Presidency. The north, the west and the south of the country had been reasonably well covered. Only the east remained.  Gandhi now proceeded to Calcutta, the venue for the special session of the Congress, held in the first week of September. Calcutta in 1920 was the greatest city in India, the former capital of the British Raj, and—not least—an epicentre of the national movement. Many early leaders of the Congress had been Bengalis from Calcutta. The revolutionary terrorists had also been most active in this city and province.  One suspects Gandhi might have approached his journey east with some trepidation. His earlier visits to Calcutta had not always been happy or productive. He first went there in 1896, seeking support for his campaign for Indian rights in South Africa. Every newspaper editor he met showed him the door. In the twenty-four years since that first visit, Gandhi had become much better known in Bengal. No editor in Calcutta—or anywhere else in India—could afford to ignore him. But he was keenly aware of the Bengali bhadralok’s sense of superiority. They had been the first to take to English education, the first to ask for rights for women, the first to articulate the demand for political freedom.  Gokhale had once said that what Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow. This was extremely generous, for Gokhale’s native Maharashtra had produced its precocious social reformers too. Bengal and Bengalis might allow that Maharashtrians were also politically sophisticated and culturally emancipated. But they were less willing to acknowledge a mere Gujarati as an equal. Gandhi’s asceticism also grated on the epicurean Bengalis, themselves fond of good food and wine, and of music and art, tastes which Gandhi had conspicuously failed to cultivate. 9 Gandhi arrived at Calcutta’s Howrah station on the night of 3 September. He was received by his son Harilal, to whose home in Pollock Street he then proceeded. The next morning he visited the venue of the Congress. The pandal was adorned with flags and slogans saying ‘Nations by Themselves are Made’, ‘Remember Jallianwala Bagh’, ‘Home Rule is our Birthright’ and ‘Hindu– Mussalman ki jai’. 10 At a session on the first day, Annie Besant was shouted down by the delegates, because of her opposition to the policy of non-cooperation. Gandhi stood up on a chair and with folded hands asked the hecklers to quieten down. Every speaker, he said, must be given a patient hearing. This was a handsome gesture, since, back in 1916, Mrs Besant had demanded that he stop speaking in Banaras when his words offended her. 11 On 5 September, Gandhi circulated a note he had freshly drafted on non-cooperation. This asked for seven forms of action: surrender of titles and honorary posts; refusal to attend government functions; ‘gradual withdrawal’ of children from government schools and colleges, and establishment of national schools and colleges in their place; ‘gradual boycott’ of British courts by lawyers and litigants, and establishment of private arbitration courts in their place; refusal by Indians to serve as soldiers, labourers or clerks in the new British government in Mesopotamia; boycott of legislative councils; and boycott of foreign goods.12 On 8 September, Gandhi formally moved his resolution on non-cooperation. Speeches and the ‘mere expression of angry feeling’, he said, had proved inadequate ‘to bend the Government to our will’. Carried away by the moment, Gandhi now made what (even at the time) must have seemed an extremely reckless promise. ‘If there is a sufficient response to my scheme,’ he proclaimed, ‘I make bold to reiterate my statement that you can gain swarajya in the course of a year.’ Gandhi’s resolution was seconded by Motilal Nehru, who, pressed by his radical son Jawaharlal, had come around to the virtues of non-cooperation. On the other side, Jinnah, Malaviya and Mrs Besant spoke vigorously against the motion. After the speeches, the votes were cast and counted— 1855 delegates voted for Gandhi’s resolution, 873 against. The provincial break-up was revealing: Bombay (243 yes, 93 no), UP (259 vs 28) and Punjab (254 vs 92) most strongly supported Gandhi, while Madras (161 to 135) and Bengal (551 to 395) were more divided. In the Central Provinces, Gandhi’s supporters were actually in a minority (30 to 33). 13 In terms of numbers, Gandhi had won the day. But the debates had been prolonged, and many long-serving Congressmen had opposed the motion. The Bengal leaders B.C. Pal and C.R. Das now worked to effect a compromise. The annual session of the Congress was due to meet in Nagpur in December. Why not wait until then to have the decision ratified? The meeting ended with the acceptance of non-cooperation in principle, but a deferral of the decision to put it into practice. 14 IV From Calcutta, Gandhi returned to Ahmedabad for a week’s rest, and then resumed his travels. In October, he spent two weeks in the United Provinces, speaking in ten different towns. By far the most important of these was Aligarh. The town was home to the great Muslim University, alma mater of both Shaukat and Mohammad Ali, but also a bastion of Empire loyalism. Gandhi and the Ali Brothers arrived in Aligarh on 11 October, hoping to win its students over to the cause of non-cooperation.15 They gave a series of speeches in Aligarh that had mixed results; the students finding it difficult to follow Gandhi’s still imperfect Hindustani. 16 Even less impressed were the trustees of the university. They refused outright the request of Gandhi and the Ali Brothers that they return their government grant and become a ‘National University’.  Writing to Gandhi, the trustees said they would ‘firmly adhere to our old established policy’ of staying away from politics, which, in effect, meant taking the side of the authorities.17 Accompanying Gandhi on this trip was Mahadev Desai. He did not entirely share his master’s enchantment with the Ali Brothers. ‘This Shaukat Ali is becoming intolerable now,’ wrote Mahadev to Devadas Gandhi, ‘he is fond of pomp [and] there was nothing but tamasha in Mathura yesterday.’ At Aligarh, Mahadev wanted Gandhi to meet with groups of students, but they were overruled by Shaukat and his programme of ‘endless hustle and processions and public meetings’.18 Gandhi and the Ali Brothers now decided to start their own ‘National University’ in Aligarh. Their hope was that the poet-philosopher Muhammad Iqbal, a man comparable in stature to Tagore, would agree to be its vice chancellor. Gandhi wrote to Iqbal in Lahore urging him to accept the post. ‘I am sure it [the National University] will prosper under your cultured leadership,’ he said, adding,  ‘Hakimji Ajmal Khan and Dr. Ansari and of course the Ali Brothers desire it. I wish you could see your way to respond. Your expenses on a scale suited to the new awakening can be easily guaranteed.’19 Iqbal wrote back declining the offer. The poet, understandably, did not want to be diverted by academic politics and the raising of funds. But he did have an important suggestion to make. Iqbal observed that ‘the Muslims of India are far behind the other communities of this country. Their principal need is not Literature and Philosophy but technical Education which would make them Economically independent.’ Therefore, he said, those who were behind the new university ‘will be well advised if they make it an institution devoted mainly to the technical side of Natural Sciences supplemented by such religious Education as may be considered necessary’. 20 Having failed with Iqbal, Gandhi then persuaded the educationist Zakir Husain to take up the assignment. The university itself was shifted from Aligarh to Delhi. Named the Jamia Millia Islamia, it would function as a ‘Nationalist Muslim’ alternative to the solidly pro-British university at Aligarh.  V In the last week of October, Gandhi published a letter addressed ‘To Every Englishman in India’, signed by ‘Your faithful friend, M.K. Gandhi’. The letter began by recalling his ‘free and voluntary co-operation’ with the British government for three decades, and the services he had rendered them during their wars with the Zulus, Boers and Germans. However, said Gandhi, the unwillingness to restore the Khilafat and the ‘atrocities in the Punjab’ had ‘completely shattered my faith in the good intentions of the Government and the nation which is supporting it’.  Gandhi listed other grievances: such as the exploitation of India’s economic resources for the benefit of England; the high salaries, high military expenditure and other official extravagances ‘in utter disregard of India’s poverty’; the ‘repressive legislation’ to silence the voices ‘seeking to give expression to a nation’s agony’; and the ‘degrading treatment’ of Indians in British dominions.  Gandhi urged the English to ‘repent of the wrong done to Indians’, and to abandon repression in favour of an ‘honourable solution’. He ended by asking the rulers to ‘make common cause with the people of India whose salt you are eating. To seek to thwart their aspirations is disloyalty to the country.’21 Gandhi’s letter evoked some interesting responses from Englishmen in India. Two schoolteachers in Bangalore praised the ‘generous tone’ of the letter. Acknowledging the ‘arrogant attitude to Indians’ among many Englishmen, they themselves believed the Empire should be ‘a commonwealth of free peoples voluntarily linked together by the ties of common experience in the past and common aspirations for the future, a commonwealth which may hope to spread liberty and progress through the whole earth’. 22 Another letter, by a certain Edward Foy of Ambala Cantonment, was less measured. This called Gandhi ‘the ungratefulest of men’. ‘After all that the British Government has done,’ wrote this man angrily, ‘you have no good word for it! Where would you have been today but for the British Government which saved India from the iron grip of Germany?’ Gandhi claimed to be a ‘peacemaker’, but in the eyes of Mr Foy he was in fact a ‘peace-breaker’, ‘manufacturing worse and worse forms of agitation which threaten the lives and property of all others and of your own countrymen also’. 23 Even more intemperate was a letter sent under the pseudonym ‘Pro Bono Publico’. The letter began by calling Gandhi a ‘Prince of Liars, Son of Seven Prostitutes and Father of a thousand criminal bastards’. How can ‘an idolatrous farting Hindu’, it asked, ‘side with a pharaisical Mahomeddan’?  ‘What sympathy or thought,’ the letter continued, ‘you miserable swine, can pretend to have for the lecherous, murdering Turk, he would not piss on you or the Muslims of this country.’ Had Gandhi lived ‘under the German Govt. the first time you acted the “nimakharam” and uttered a crooked word against them, you would have been hung like the dog you are’. Yet the ‘benign and benevolent [British] government has most stupidly given you no end of rope . . .’24 Amidst this barrage of criticism and abuse, Gandhi received a letter from an Irishman who wrote ‘to wish you success in trying to obtain Swaraj. India belongs to your people and not to the English . .  .’ The writer spoke of how the ‘English have oppressed Ireland, my own dear country, for hundreds of years but we Irish never gave in and always strived for freedom and although we are not yet a Republic we shall go on doing our very best to obtain it’. With the Irish example before him, Gandhi was urged to ‘fight on for liberty’ himself.25 VI As he travelled through India, Gandhi continued to be reminded that what all parts of the country had in common was the treatment of certain castes as ‘untouchable’. He was appalled by this stigmatization by his fellow Hindus of their co-religionists. In May 1920, he emphatically declared that We cannot compare the sufferings of the untouchables with those of any other section in India. It passes my understanding how we consider it dharma to treat the depressed classes as untouchables; I shudder at the very thought of this. My conscience tells me that untouchability can never be a part of Hinduism. I do not think it too much to dedicate my whole life to removing the thick crust of sin with which Hindu society has covered itself for so long by stupidly regarding these people as untouchables. I am only sorry that I am unable to devote myself wholly to that work.26 Gandhi had now started a college in Ahmedabad to go with the school he had already founded. Called the Gujarat Vidyapith, this would be autonomous of the government and avail of no state funds. It was run as a ‘national’ college, supported by voluntary donations, and with a curriculum more suited to Indian needs than the state-run colleges that sought to train clerks for the civil service.  In October 1920, the Gujarat Vidyapith passed a resolution that no school which refused to admit ‘Antyaja’, or untouchable children, would be given approval by it. This provoked uproar among upper-caste Gujaratis, with articles and statements attacking Gandhi for undermining Hindu dharma.  To these criticisms, Gandhi pointedly asked: ‘Do we hope to win swaraj while reviving the practice of untouchability at the same time?’27 In his own ashram, of course, no caste distinctions were observed at all. Visiting Sabarmati, the Moderate politician M.R. Jayakar saw Gandhi ‘ready to eat a boiled potato with a Harijan [untouchable] girl although it had been half bitten by her’. Jayakar himself lived in Bombay, professedly a cosmopolitan city, albeit one where his fellow lawyers would not break bread with people of other castes. ‘I have,’ he wrote later, ‘never found a man so free from caste aversion as Gandhi.’ Jayakar was impressed that Gandhi, ‘the foremost leader of India’, had ‘practically rooted out caste sense from his daily concerns’.28 In early December, Gandhi wrote a long essay in Young India outlining his understanding of caste.  He said that while he accepted the traditional fourfold division known as varnashramadharma, he condemned the practice of untouchability. ‘I believe that caste has saved Hinduism from disintegration,’ he remarked. ‘But like every other institution it has suffered from excrescences.’ It was customary to rank the four varnas as follows: the Brahmins, or priests, at the top; the Kshatriyas, or warriors, next; the Vaishyas, or merchants (Gandhi’s own caste), third; the Sudras, or peasants and labourers, fourth, with a fifth class, that of the ‘untouchables’, literally beyond the pale.  However, in Gandhi’s (rather revisionist) view, ‘the caste system is not based on inequality, there is no question of inferiority, and so far as there is any such question arising . . . the tendency should undoubtedly be checked. But there appears to be no valid reason for ending the system because of its abuse. It lends itself easily to reformation. The spirit of democracy, which is fast spreading through India and the rest of the world will, without a shadow of doubt, purge the institution of the idea of predominance and subordination.’ Each of these four varnas had hundreds of jatis, or sub-castes. Traditionally, a member of a particular jati would not mix, marry or eat with the member of a jati other than his own. These prohibitions Gandhi did not as yet challenge, claiming that ‘interdrinking, interdining, intermarrying, I hold, are not essential for the promotion of the spirit of democracy’. He did not ‘contemplate under a most democratic constitution a universality of manners and customs about eating, drinking and marrying. We shall ever have to seek unity in diversity, and I decline to consider it a sin for a man not to drink or eat with anybody and everybody.’ Gandhi now added a crucial caveat: Thus whilst I am prepared to defend, as I have always done, the division of Hindus into four castes . . . I consider untouchability to be a heinous crime against humanity. It is not a sign of self-restraint but an arrogant assumption of superiority. It has served no useful purpose and it has suppressed, as nothing else in Hinduism has, vast numbers of the human race who are not only every bit as good as ourselves, but are rendering in many walks of life an essential service to the country. 29 Gandhi’s attitude towards caste, ca 1920, can be summed up in four propositions: 1. While the orthodox or literal-minded saw caste as a vertical system based on hierarchy, he would reconfigure it as a horizontal system in which no group was superior or inferior; 2. Eating, mixing and marrying were personal or communal choices—while in his own ashram he promoted inter-dining and intermingling, he would not presume to impose this on all Indians;  3. In dealing with his fellows, man must not follow the scriptures, but his own conscience.  4. Untouchability was not just a social question, but also a moral one. The practice was wrong,  unjust, cruel. Therefore, it had to be eradicated.  By 1920, Gandhi saw the abolition of untouchability as being as significant as the consolidation of Hindu–Muslim unity. For the movement for swaraj to be politically strong, it had to transcend religious differences; for it to be morally credible, it had to put an end to the treatment of a large section of Indians as less-than-human.  VII After the special session of the Congress in Calcutta, Gandhi resumed his travels. In October, he toured the Punjab and the United Provinces; in November, the Bombay Presidency and his native Gujarat. The magnificently detailed chronology of his life by Chandubhai Dalal30 tells us that he visited nineteen towns and cities in the first month, and as many as twenty-nine in the second.  Everywhere, he spoke at public meetings and, before or after these meetings, talked to delegates likely to attend the Congress session in Nagpur in December.  Gandhi’s travels were mostly by train, on tracks built by British firms after the Great Rebellion of 1857. At the time of the rebellion there were merely a few hundred miles of railway track in the subcontinent; by the end of the century, this had jumped to more than 30,000. The railways criss-crossed the country, connecting east and west, south and north. 31 Gandhi usually spent a day (or less) in the places he visited. His longest stay was at Allahabad, where he spent as many as four days. He was welcomed at the station by Motilal and Jawaharlal Nehru, and with ‘blowing conches and ringing bells’. 32 Talks to students at Allahabad University and a large public meeting had been arranged. In between, he had long conversations with the Nehrus.  Jawaharlal had recently visited the district of Pratapgarh, where discontented peasants, led by a sadhu called Baba Ram Chandra, had started a no-tax campaign. This direct exposure to rural poverty had further radicalized the younger Nehru. He was now urging his father to put his weight more fully behind Gandhi’s movement. 33 VIII As Gandhi combed the country, canvassing support for non-cooperation, his relationship with Saraladevi Chaudhurani once more came under strain. This is visibly manifest in a series of letters written by Sarala to Gandhi in October 1920, these among the very few by her to have survived. 34 In the second week of October, Sarala journeyed to Ahmedabad in the hope of spending some time with Gandhi. However, he was out, on the road. From the ashram, she wrote to him about what she was doing while he was away—wearing saris made of khaddar, and persuading society women in Ahmedabad to do likewise. But she wished he was there. ‘The bathroom is the only place to receive my sobs,’ she wrote. ‘But I am hoping they will come to an end very soon.’35 Eventually, tired of waiting, Sarala travelled back to her home in Lahore. From there she wrote to Gandhi about the ‘misconceptions’ between them, and of her ‘anger’ at his not giving her ‘a free hand’ in how she wished to live her life. When, in a recent conversation, she had accused him of harbouring ‘harsh thoughts’ and of having an ‘adamantine’ pride, Gandhi had answered that he was ‘activated by love’ in his ‘punishment’ of her. Now, Sarala challenged him to directly declare his feelings for her.  ‘If it be love,’ she told Gandhi, ‘tell me . . . in simple touching language you are missing me daily, suffering the pangs of separation yourself [as she was], longing for the dawn of the day when we shall meet again. If it be love, let pride be prostrate once and for all and love use its language in a free flow once more.’ On the other hand, said Sarala to Gandhi, if it was the case that ‘love is killed and cannot be revived any more’, then he should ‘confess that freely and do not bear a “White man’s burden” for the uplift of the Black’.36 Two days later, Sarala wrote again. She was hurt that Gandhi had charged her ‘with a new sin to [add to] my many older ones—that of jealousy’. Sarala admitted that like other human beings, she was not entirely free of that emotion. ‘But what of that in our relationship?’ she remarked. ‘Do you mean to say that I am jealous of you? I can only laugh at the charge & wonder at your biased reading of me.’ Sarala concluded that Gandhi and she were ‘at cross purposes, it seems’. ‘The misunderstandings can’t be cleared up by the post,’ she added. 37 It seems that Gandhi thought so too, for after his United Provinces tour, he decided to carry on to the Punjab to meet her.  Gandhi reached Lahore on 19 October. He stayed two days with the Chaudhuris. However, Sarala and he could not get much time to themselves, since an unending stream of students came to pay their respects to the visitor. In a letter written to Gandhi the day after he left, Sarala suggested a temporary truce. As she somewhat poetically put it: ‘Let us not tread on delicate grounds for some time and agree to differ in our respective views on certain topics. Shall we? Let God’s light be thrown on the actions & motives & thoughts of both of us & not our individual lights.’38 In Gandhi’s life, politics was now rapidly taking precedence over friendship. On 11 December, Gandhi wrote Sarala an answer to ‘a longish letter which shows that you do not understand my language or my thoughts. I have certainly not betrayed any annoyance over your complex nature, but I have remarked upon it.’ He continued: ‘In you I have an enigma to solve. I shall not be impatient. Only bear with me whenever I try to point [out] what to me appear to be your obvious limitations. We all have them. It is the privilege of friendship to lay the gentle finger on the weak spots.’39 Sarala was tired of being asked to live the simple life. And she seemed to have reservations about Gandhi’s political programme too. Mahadev Desai’s diary for 17 December 1920 has this entry: ‘Saraladevi had written: Non-co-operation was based on hatred [of the British] and she loved Bapu the less therefore. She would love Bapu more if he was free of hatred; an activity, moreover, like non-co-operation could be taken up by others also.’40 Sarala’s reservations may have been stoked by her famous uncle. Gandhi’s campaign of non-cooperation provoked ambivalent feelings in Tagore; as he wrote to their mutual friend C.F. Andrews, he wished the emotion would flow along constructive channels. If that happened, said Tagore, ‘I shall be willing to sit at his [Gandhi’s] feet and do his bidding, if he commands me to co-operate with my countrymen in service of love. I refuse to waste my manhood in lighting the fire of anger and spreading it from house to house.’41 On receiving Saraladevi’s letter of 17 December, Gandhi wrote back immediately. He first answered her reservations about his political method. ‘You would be right in your regret over my being engaged in N[on]-C[o-]O[peration] if it was a matter of politics with me,’ remarked Gandhi.  ‘As it is, with me it is my religion. I am gathering together all the forces of hate and directing them in a proper channel. . . . If I could but show our countrymen that we need not fear the English, we will cease to hate them.’ The second, and more significant, paragraph of the letter turned to their relationship. I have reproduced it more or less in extenso, deleting only the odd repetitive thought/sentence: I have been analysing my love for you. I have reached a definite meaning of spiritual wife. It is a partnership between two persons of the opposite sex where the physical is wholly absent. . . . It is possible only between two brahmacharis in thought, word and deed. I have felt drawn to you, because I have recognized in you an identity of ideals and aspirations and a complete self-surrender.  You have been ‘wife’ because you have recognized in me a fuller fruition of the common ideal than in yourself. . . . It follows from what I have stated that spiritual partners can never be physically wedded either in this life or a future, for it is possible only when there is no carnality, latent or patent. Are you spiritual wife to me of that description? Have we that exquisite purity, that perfect coincidence, that perfect merging, that identity of ideals, that self-forgetfulness, that fixity of purpose, that trustfulness? For me I can answer plainly that it is only an aspiration. I am unworthy to have that companionship with you. I require in me an infinitely higher purity than I possess in thought. I am too physically attached to you to be worthy of enjoying that sacred association with you. By physical attachment I here mean I am too much affected by your weaknesses. I must not be teacher to you, if I am your spiritual husband, if coincidence or merging is felt. On the contrary there are sharp differences between you and me so often. So far as I can see our relationship, it is one of brother and sister. I must lay down the law for you, and thus ruffle you. I must plead gently like a brother ever taking care to use the right word even as I do to my oldest sister. I must not be father, husband, friend, teacher all rolled into one. This is the big letter I promised. With dearest love I still subscribe myself, Yours LAW-GIVER42 This letter lacks the clarity and precision that marks Gandhi’s writings. Amidst the confusion and complexity, one can, however, discern a few distinct strands. The first is the strongly patriarchal tone —the husband is the Law-Giver, to whose superior will the wife must bend. A second and allied note is the presumption that Gandhi’s way of life is also superior—he has achieved a ‘fuller fruition’ of the nationalist ideal. A third is the visible tension between Gandhi’s commitment to celibacy and his attraction to Saraladevi. He does not, he confesses here, have that ‘infinitely higher purity [in practice] that I possess in thought’.  This letter does seem to have taken their relationship almost to breaking point. After this missive of 17 December, Saraladevi Chaudhurani’s name appears very infrequently in the Collected Works. That it was Gandhi who took the decision to end their friendship/spiritual marriage is manifest from a letter he wrote to C. Rajagopalachari three years later. ‘Yes, your guess is correct,’ writes Gandhi.  ‘The fair friend is Sar[a]ladevi. She wants to bombard me with more stuff but I have refused to give further accommodation.’43 As the colleague who had cautioned Gandhi against deepening the relationship, Rajaji must have read these words with a sense of relief and also, one supposes, vindication.  IX Gandhi arrived in Nagpur for the Congress on 20 December 1920, accompanied by Shaukat Ali. They were received by a large crowd, which took them in an open carriage through the streets. Gandhi was staying in a lodge run by his fellow vegetarians, the Marwari community. 44 On Christmas Day—the day before the Congress began—Gandhi gave two talks, one to a group of weavers, the other to a meeting of ‘untouchables’. He told the former that ‘I regard myself a farmer-weaver’, urged them to revive their profession, and expressed dismay that the cloth they wore was not produced by themselves.  The speech to the ‘untouchables’ was longer and more personal. Here Gandhi spoke of how ‘I have to suffer much in trying to carry my wife with me in what I have been doing’ (to end untouchability).  He noted that ‘at present I am engaged in a great dispute with the Hindus in Gujarat’ on the same question. Calling the practice of untouchability ‘a great Satanism in Hinduism’, he observed: ‘I have said to the Hindus, and say it again today, that till Hindu society is purged of this sin, swaraj is an impossibility.’ Even so, Gandhi advocated a cautious, incrementalist approach to the activists who had gathered to hear him. They wanted to have a resolution passed at the Congress demanding that ‘untouchables’ should be allowed to enter all temples. Gandhi responded: ‘How is this possible? So long as Varnashram dharma occupies the central place in Hinduism, it is vain that you ask that every Hindu should be free to enter a temple right now. It is impossible to get society to accept this. It is not prepared for this yet.’ Gandhi noted that some temples in South India were closed even to him (because he had refused to wear a thread signifying his upper-caste status). Others were open only to members of certain sects. ‘I don’t feel unhappy about this,’ he remarked. ‘I am not even prepared to say that this betrays the Hindus’ narrow outlook or that it is a wrong they are committing. Maybe it is, but we should consider the line of thinking behind it. If their action is inspired by considerations of discipline, I would not say that everyone should be free to go to any temple.’ Gandhi added: ‘I myself eat and drink in the company of Antyajas. I have adopted the daughter of an Antyaj [“untouchable”] family and she is dearer to me than my own life.’ The girl was Lakshmi, daughter of Dudhabhai and Danibehn, admitted to the ashram in 1915. While himself extremely heterodox, Gandhi felt that he could not yet ‘tell Hindu society that it might abandon its self-control’. 45 From social reform, Gandhi plunged straight into politics. 46 On 30 December, he spoke to the Congress on the crucial non-cooperation resolution. This asked for ‘the establishment of an Indian Republic’ through the programme already outlined by Gandhi in Calcutta, namely, the boycotting by students of government schools and colleges, by lawyers of courts, by merchants of foreign goods, by voters and representatives of councils. Policemen and soldiers were requested to ‘refuse to subordinate their creed and country to the fulfilment of orders of their [British] officers’. The resolution also appealed to all government servants, ‘pending the call of the nation for resignation of their service, to help the national cause by importing greater kindness and stricter honesty in their dealings with the people’.  The resolution was in eleven paragraphs, the last of which called for individuals and organizations to ‘advance Hindu–Muslim unity’, for ‘the leading Hindus to settle the disputes between Brahmin and non-Brahmin’ (these particularly acute in the Madras Presidency), and for a ‘special effort to rid Hinduism of the reproach of untouchability’. 47 Gandhi asked the delegates to carry the resolution ‘with a prayer to God from the deepest recesses of your heart’, and to ‘show no violence in thought, deed or word whether in connection with the Government or whether in connection with ourselves’. His exhortations were met with loud cries and cheers of ‘Mahatma Gandhi ki jai’. 48 Gandhi was the star of what was the biggest Congress yet. As many as 14,582 delegates came.  There were also more Muslims (1050) and more women (169) than ever before. The Congress was presided over by the veteran C. Vijayaraghavachariar, who was completely in thrall to Gandhi. In a long, rambling presidential address, he quoted Burke, Lincoln and the ‘Hindu idea of polity’, before speaking of the ‘process of national unification’ that had ‘greatly expanded and intensified under the auspices of Mahatmaji Gandhi and the stalwart patriots who are co-operating with him’.49 The vast majority of the delegates at Nagpur were with Gandhi, and so were the leaders. As the official history of the Congress was to later put it,  the support that Gandhi obtained at Nagpur was undoubtedly greater than what he had in Calcutta. In Calcutta, the only top-notch politician [who] had lent a helping hand to Gandhi, and that rather late in the day, was Pandit Motilal Nehru . . . Else the stool of [non-co-operation] was resting on but one leg. At Nagpur, it stood on all its four legs with perfect equipoise. Gandhi and Nehru, Das and Lalaji [Lajpat Rai] were all for it.50 Although the party historian would not mention it, there was in fact a ‘top-notch politician’ who did not go along with Gandhi in Nagpur. This was Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Jinnah had stayed away from the Khilafat movement, uncomfortable with the strident militancy of the Ali Brothers; now he would stay away from Gandhi’s struggle too. In a speech of controlled passion, Jinnah opposed the non-cooperation resolution for two reasons: because so long as the British were in control of the government machinery, a unilateral declaration of swaraj, or independence, was ‘mere sentimental feeling and expression of anger and desperation’, a ‘declaration which you have not the means to carry out’; and because he did not want to make a fetish of non-cooperation, a method which in his view would ‘not succeed in destroying the British Empire’. The Congress under Gandhi’s direction was, said Jinnah, adopting a course that was ‘neither logical nor politically sound’.  Jinnah was booed and barracked at regular intervals. When he referred to ‘Mr. Muhammad Ali’ there were angry cries of ‘Maulana’, ‘Maulana’, the honorific usually used before Mohammad Ali’s name. When Jinnah ended his speech, by appealing to Gandhi ‘to pause, to cry halt before it is too late’, he was answered by shouts of ‘Shame! Shame!’ and ‘Mahatma Gandhi ki jai’. 51 Jinnah’s dissent apart, this was from first to last a Gandhi show. The Congress organization was now effectively his to control and direct. A week after the meeting, the viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, wrote to the secretary of state in London that ‘Gandhi has had undoubtedly a great personal triumph,  and I gather . . . that he really dominated the whole situation’. Then he hopefully added: ‘Yet I fancy that a feeling of soreness has been left behind with those who do not see eye to eye with Gandhi . .  .’52 CHAPTER SEVEN The Rise and Fall of Non-cooperation I Gandhi wanted to make the Congress more Indian, and he wanted it to have a properly representative character. So it was resolved to have party units at different levels: that of the province, the district and the taluk (sub-district). Taluk, district and provincial committees were constituted, their members chosen by election. The provinces would in turn send members for the All India Congress Committee (AICC). The most select and powerful body was the Congress Working Committee (CWC), which had about fifteen members and was where all major party decisions were taken.  In its own workings, the Congress had now replaced the administrative divisions of British India with one which explicitly recognized the linguistic diversity of the subcontinent. Outside the Hindi-speaking heartland, every major language group had its own provincial unit. There was no longer a Madras Presidency Congress, but there were now a Karnataka Provincial Congress Committee (KPCC), an Andhra PCC, a Maharashtra PCC, etc. The party’s apex body, the CWC, took care to reflect this diversity. In 1921, for example, it had a member apiece from Gujarat (represented by Gandhi), Maharashtra, Bengal and Assam, Bihar and Orissa, and Andhra. Of the three general secretaries, Motilal Nehru was from the United Provinces, C. Rajagopalachari from Tamilnadu, and Dr M.A. Ansari from Delhi. The treasurer, Jamnalal Bajaj, was from the Central Provinces.  Meanwhile, the AICC, second only to the CWC in importance, was also becoming more representative. In 1919, it had a mere eighteen Muslim members; three years later it had as many as eighty-four (out of a total of 350). This was part of Gandhi’s attempt to ensure that the Congress could not be dismissed as a ‘Hindu party’.  The Nagpur constitution introduced the idea of paid membership. For the modest sum of four annas (one-fourth of a rupee), anyone over eighteen years of age could become a member of the Congress, and participate in its discussions at the taluk or district level, or join a trade union, peasant organization or women’s group working under the Congress umbrella.1 Gandhi’s attempts to make the Congress a mass organization were successful. In the months after the Nagpur Congress, tens of thousands of primary members enrolled in each of the provinces. By the end of the year, the party had close to 2 million members. Before Gandhi took charge, the Congress was dominated by lawyers, editors and scholars, who brought the high status of their professional position to their work in the party. But with the non-cooperation movement, the ability or desire to abandon one’s profession became a critical attribute. As one historian of the party puts it: ‘The significant difference between the pre-1920 and the post-1920 Congress leadership lay in the fact that before 1920 it was social position which automatically conferred a leading role in the movement; after 1920 it was the renunciation of social position and the demonstration of willingness to accept sacrifice that was demanded of those who aspired to lead.’2 Men such as C.R. Das, Motilal Nehru and C. Rajagopalachari gained in prestige and public acclaim because they had abandoned their lucrative legal practices to serve the nation.  II Gandhi spent the second half of January 1921 in Bengal, raising money for the non-cooperation movement. His wife, Kasturba, was with him. While he was in Calcutta, Gandhi received a letter from C.F. Andrews, complaining that he was spending too much time on his campaign against untouchability. Gandhi replied that while, as an Englishman and Christian, Andrews was merely an observer, as an Indian and Hindu, Gandhi was ‘an affected and afflicted party. You can be patient, and I cannot. . . . I have to deal with the Hindu Dyers.’ By comparing upper-caste Hindus to General Dyer, Gandhi was underlining his disgust with the practice of untouchability. He was, he told Andrews, ‘engaged as a Hindu in showing that it is not a sin and that it is sin to consider that touch a sin’. It was ‘a bigger problem than that of gaining Indian independence’, said Gandhi, continuing prophetically: ‘It is not impossible that India may free herself from English domination before India has become free of the curse of untouchability.’3 From Calcutta, Gandhi proceeded to the mineral-rich areas of Bihar. In the coalfield town of Jharia, where there was a large community of Gujaratis, he held a public meeting, and collected 60,000 rupees in cash and jewellery. A lady in the crowd put her gold necklace around Kasturba’s neck and was about to adorn her wrists with gold bracelets. Kasturba protested—taking off the necklace, she said the collection was for the nation’s swaraj, not for her personally. The lady then gave Gandhi the necklace, but begged Kasturba to at least wear the bracelets. As Mahadev Desai wryly noted in his diary: ‘Kasturba refused—with the result that the Swaraj fund was robbed of the bracelets.’4 The incident showed the long distance Kasturba had travelled in her own political journey. Back in 1901, when the grateful Indians of Natal presented the Gandhis with jewellery, husband and wife had a terrific row. He wanted to return the gifts, but she, thinking of her future daughters-in-law, thought that since they were given in good faith the jewels could be retained. 5 Now, twenty years later, Kasturba would accept gifts of necklaces and bracelets to aid Gandhi’s campaigns, while denying them for herself.  From Bihar, Kasturba went back to Ahmedabad, while her husband continued his non-cooperation tour. He visited several towns in the United Provinces, before moving on to the Punjab. Then he moved south, where, in the first week of April, the AICC met at Vijayawada. In attendance was an Andhra Congressman named P. Venkayya, who for several years had been pressing Gandhi to adopt a ‘national’ flag for the nation-in-the-making. This time too Venkayya made the same proposal, but in the design he offered, Gandhi ‘saw nothing to stir the nation to its depths’. Then Lala Hansraj of Jullundur suggested that the spinning wheel should find a place on the Swaraj Flag. Gandhi was struck by the suggestion, and asked Venkayya to give him a design containing a spinning wheel on a background of saffron (denoting Hindu) and green (denoting Muslim).  The enthusiastic Venkayya produced a design in three hours. Gandhi looked at it, and realized that a colour was also needed for the other religions of India. He suggested white be added to the saffron and the green. For, ‘Hindu–Muslim unity is not an exclusive term; it is an inclusive term, symbolic of the unity of all faiths domiciled in India. If Hindus and Muslims can tolerate each other, they are bound to tolerate all other faiths.’ Gandhi further suggested the order in which the colours should be placed: white first, next green, finally saffron, in progressive order of numerical importance, ‘the idea being that the strongest should act as a shield to the weakest’. Eventually, the white was placed in the middle, between the saffron and the green, the two major religions symbolically surrounding and protecting the others.6 III In his travels through India, Gandhi was often accompanied by one or both the Ali Brothers. At public meetings they would appear jointly, and speak in turn. This double act signified both the growing Hindu–Muslim unity and the coupling of Khilafat and non-cooperation.  The Ali Brothers do seem to have genuinely admired Gandhi. Speaking to a mixed audience of Hindus and Muslims in a town in the United Provinces, Mohammad Ali called Gandhi ‘a brave man, a true man’, who would ‘sacrifice his life and property for the cause of India’.7 Speaking in another United Provinces town, Shaukat Ali proclaimed that ‘today Mahatmaji is the leader of all of us, Hindus and Muslims, and if you Hindus and Muslims obey Mahatmaji and act on his advice and sacrifice your life and property for country and religion you will be gifted with all the blessings of this world and the next’. Then he continued: The fact is though [his] bones are small and Mahatma Gandhi is a lean and thin man and I have repeatedly said I could if I liked place him in my pocket with my left hand, yet his heart is so large that this Government has no power save that of fear . . .  Brethren, the work of Mahatma Gandhi is now the work of the whole country . . . Each one of the 33 crores [of Indians] is now a Gandhi. 8 These joint tours of Hindu and Muslim leaders caused some discomfort among the authorities. There can ‘be no doubt’, wrote a senior official of the Madras Presidency, ‘that both Gandhi and the Ali Brothers create tremendous temporary enthusiasm and attract enormous crowds wherever they go’.  Some came out of mere curiosity, ‘but a large number, and especially women, seem to be inspired with feelings of real adoration for the Mahatma and many thousand rupees worth of jewels were collected at his meetings’.9 For all their mutual affection, the Ali Brothers did not share Gandhi’s principled commitment to ahimsa, or non-violence. This extract from a speech made by Mohammad Ali in the town of Fyzabad in February 1921 is illustrative: The Mussalmans wanted to seek the alliance of Gandhiji in the work of the Khilafat but I told them that we could not make him our ally as he wanted to banish from our hearts all thought of using the sword. I declared that God has given me the right to use the sword against any adversary when I had the power to do so and that no one could then stop me. This is our creed. But now we know and we see that our country does not possess that power and so long as we do not have that power we will be his (Gandhiji’s) associates . . . [W]e are, therefore, standing today on the same platform—he for reasons of principle and we for those of policy. 10 The adherence of the Ali Brothers to non-violence was purely tactical. In a speech in the Gujarati town of Broach, Mohammad Ali said that while for the present they would keep the sword in its sheath, ‘we must reserve the right to take up arms against the enemies of Islam’.11 In response to the British refusal to restore the Khilafat, some Muslims had migrated to Afghanistan. They were following an ancient practice known as hijrat, sanctioned by the Prophet himself, whereby one left a state that refused to honour Islam for a state that upheld the principles of the faith. 12 Afghanistan was an independent Islamic state, whose amir did not have the best relations with the Raj. Speaking in Madras in April 1921, Mohammad Ali said if the amir of Afghanistan invaded India to overthrow the British, it was the duty of Indian Muslims to support him. 13 This was an extremely provocative statement, for only two years previously, the British and the Afghans had fought a bloody war, with thousands of casualties on both sides. Gandhi was unhappy with Mohammad Ali seeming to favour the amir. The British were absolutely livid. In May, Gandhi was in Simla, the summer capital of the Raj, when Madan Mohan Malaviya suggested that he meet the new viceroy, Lord Reading. Gandhi, with his long-standing belief in dialogue, agreed. Reading was new to India; this was the time to press upon him the demands of the Indians.  In the third week of May, Gandhi had several meetings with the viceroy. Afterwards, Lord Reading wrote to his son: ‘There is no hesitation about him, there is a ring of sincerity in all he utters, save when discussing some political questions. . . . [H]e is convinced to a point almost bordering on fanaticism, that non-violence and love will give India its independence . . .’14 One of the subjects Gandhi and Reading discussed was the language of the Ali Brothers. The viceroy’s advisers told him that in their speeches the brothers had offered incitements to violence, and were thus liable to prosecution and arrest. When this was put to Gandhi, he said he would get the brothers to commit themselves to his own creed of non-violence. He hoped that would persuade the viceroy to stay their arrest.  On Gandhi’s suggestion, the Ali Brothers issued a statement clarifying that they did not intend prescribing violence as a means of bringing about political change. This led to a certain amount of gloating in government circles, and on the other side, anger against Gandhi among some Muslims. His friend Abdul Bari wrote him a letter saying that by making the Ali Brothers ‘apologize for fictitious violence’, he had humiliated them in the eyes of the community and lowered the prestige of the movement itself.15 IV While mobilizing popular support, Gandhi also set about collecting money for his movement. The Congress had started a ‘Tilak Swaraj Fund’, for which Gandhi had set a target of Rs 1 crore (equivalent to 10 million, or 100 lakh). Each province had been assigned a target of its own.  Gandhi first focused on Kathiawar, the part of Gujarat where he had himself been born and raised.  ‘Kathiawaris claim me as one of themselves,’ he wrote. ‘Their love for me will now be tested. If, despite their love for me, I fail in convincing them, how can I ever hope to win over other Indians?’16 The Kathiawaris contributed Rs 2 lakh to the Tilak Fund, four times the target specified for them.  The British-ruled areas of Gujarat responded even more energetically to Gandhi’s call. The state contributed more than Rs 13 lakh, almost half coming from Ahmedabad alone. 17 Gandhi next trained his eye on the city of Bombay, whose Gujarati merchants belonged to three distinct religions: Hinduism, Islam and Zoroastrianism. While Gujarati Hindus and Gujarati Muslims had long supported Gandhi, the Parsis were mostly Empire loyalists. In an open letter ‘To the Parsis’, Gandhi recalled the ‘sacred ties’ that bound him to them, such as the mentorship of Dadabhai Naoroji and the support given to his movement in South Africa by the Parsis. 18 Some Parsis were persuaded by his appeal. One, from the famous Godrej family that manufactured safes and almirahs, donated Rs 3 lakh to the Tilak fund, by far the largest single contribution. ‘Mr. Godrej’s generosity,’ remarked Gandhi, ‘puts the Parsis easily first in India.’ Meanwhile, his friend Parsi Rustomji had sent Rs 52,000 from South Africa.19 Gandhi appealed for funds through print, and in person. He spent almost a month in Bombay, going from one locality to the next, gathering notes, coins, cheques and jewels. On 26 June 1921, some 20,000 people gathered in a merchant’s godown in central Bombay, to present a purse to Gandhi. As one eyewitness reported, ‘The heat was oppressive and owing to the over-crowding the audience endured much discomfort. Many of them unable to bear it any longer left the place before Gandhi arrived, but dropped their contributions into the collecting boxes as they left. Gandhi, however, stuck it out to the end, intent only on the collection of as large a sum as possible.’ Gandhi collected nearly Rs 5 lakh in this one meeting. These included small donations by individuals as well as larger contributions by guilds or trade bodies.  Other days in Bombay were even more successful. In C.B. Dalal’s chronology of Gandhi’s Indian years, the entry for 30 June 1921 reads: ‘Bombay: Visited, accepted purses from, and addressed various institutions and organizations’.  From the intelligence reports of the Bombay government, we can flesh out the day in greater and richer detail. Gandhi’s first meeting was at the northern suburb of Borivili. Collecting Rs 45,000 from its residents, he then traced his way back to the city. At 1 p.m. he visited the Mangaldas Cloth Market in the company of the Ali Brothers and Sarojini Naidu, collecting upward of Rs 35,000. He then attended a meeting of Lohanas at Mandvi, around three thousand-strong, some eight hundred women among them. This Gujarati merchant caste had raised Rs 1,10,000 for their compatriot. The Lohanas were advised by Gandhi ‘to use Swadeshi clothes, to give national education to their children and to take up national work’.  Gandhi’s next stop was Grant Road, where, at 3.30 p.m., he met the jewellers of Bombay. A group collection of Rs 10,000 was offered to him, after which a jeweller named Gulab Devchand handed over the impressive sum of Rs 2,32,000, ‘together with an address which was written out on a khadi handkerchief and contained a prayer that God would help Gandhi in reaching the goal of Swaraj to which they all aspired’. Gandhi’s merchant friend Revashankar Jagjivan gave him Rs 25,000, while a further Rs 60,000 ‘were collected from small associations and bodies, including the Grass Merchants, Plumbers, etc. . . .’ At 5 p.m., the indefatigable Gandhi was in the posh locality of Colaba. Here, after the Colaba cotton merchants had presented him a purse of Rs 1,54,000, ‘two bales of cotton were also put up for auction; the one on which Gandhi was sitting went for Rs 6,100; the other, not so pleasantly favoured, only fetched Rs 2,500’.  Gandhi’s next meeting was with the Parsis, at a place well suited for a community which pioneered modern Indian drama—the Excelsior Theatre. ‘The leaders of Parsi Society were conspicuous by their absence’; but sections of the Parsi middle class were present, among them the prominent lawyer K.F. Nariman. A purse of Rs 30,000 was handed over, after which ‘Gandhi and the various Parsi speakers flattered each other on their many noble qualities and achievements, and Gandhi suggested that the Parsi ladies should come out and assist the volunteers on picketing duty’.  Gandhi then seems to have been taken by his minders for supper. The next meeting, the last for the day, started at 9.30 p.m. It was organized by the Mandvi District Congress Committee. Admission was by tickets priced at Re 1 and Rs 2. Some 10,000 people were present, and ‘the usual speeches advising the use of Swadeshi cloth instead of foreign and the adoption of the Charkha were made by Gandhi, the Ali Brothers and Mrs. Naidu’. About a lakh of rupees was collected along with a few items of jewellery.  It had been an exhausting day for Gandhi, but also a productive one. The police mole following him around from meeting to meeting surely shared his weariness, but perhaps not his satisfaction. 20 V All through 1921, members of the Congress acted on the principles of non-cooperation. Some returned medals or honours bestowed upon them by the colonial government. Teachers in government schools stayed away from work. So did many students in government colleges. Members of provincial legislative councils resigned. So did those who served on university senates or town municipalities.  A file in the papers of the AICC contains a register, ninety-five pages long, with names of individuals in different provinces who, in various ways, sought not to cooperate with the government.  Thus ‘the three Desai brothers of Hubli resigned [from] the membership of the Taluka Local Board’.  The chief imam of Madras, Maulvi Shah Zahid Hussain Khadri, returned the title of Shamsul Ulama that the viceroy had accorded him. The students of the Sanatana Dharma Sabha High School in Amritsar went on strike until it stopped receiving government funds and became a certifiably ‘national’ school. So did the students of the Islamia High School, Etawah. 21 Withdrawing association with the government was one canon of the non-cooperation creed. The boycott of foreign cloth was another. Back in 1919, Gandhi had urged that patriots wear Indian clothes. At the same time, he had explicitly ruled out the burning of foreign cloth on the grounds that it would promote ill will against Europeans. But now, pressed by the militants in his ranks, he sanctioned a practice he had previously opposed. The precedent that was invoked was the swadeshi movement of 1905–07, where foreign goods had often been burnt in public meetings.  On 31 July, Gandhi himself inaugurated a nationwide campaign, lighting a bonfire of foreign cloth in Bombay, his act accompanied by shouts and cheers. The crowd was huge: ‘overflowing with men and women dressing handsomely in white khadi caps and khadi clothes, [it] gave one the impression that the entire population of Bombay had assembled there’.  Gandhi told the gathering that ‘we are purifying ourselves by discarding foreign cloth which is the badge of our slavery’. After the meeting, the crowd—men, women and children—went to Chowpatti to pay homage to Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who had been cremated on that spot a year previously. 22 In Bombay and elsewhere, women were particularly active in picketing liquor shops. The temperance campaign, in which Gandhi took a special interest, led to a dramatic fall in the consumption of alcohol and in state revenue from its sale. As a government report mournfully noted, in the financial year 1921–22 the excise revenue of Punjab fell by 33 lakh rupees, of Bihar and Orissa by 10 lakh rupees and of Bombay by 6 lakh rupees.23 These activities were all, so to say, ‘authorized’ by the Congress and in conformity with its creed.  But the name and appeal of Gandhi also inspired acts that he and his party would have regarded as transgressive or even wrong. Peasants in the Indo-Gangetic plains refused to pay taxes, saying ‘Gandhi Maharaj’ had told them not to do so. They also travelled ticketless on trains, invoking the same authority. Peasants in the Himalaya broke forest laws and refused to carry the luggage of officials, again using Gandhi’s name. Disenchanted workers in factories were emboldened by the non-cooperation campaign to go on strike. 24 VI Two among Gandhi’s close friends were not entirely sympathetic with his movement. C.F. Andrews wrote that he was ‘supremely happy’ when Gandhi took on evils like drink, drugs and race arrogance.  ‘But lighting bonfires of foreign cloth and telling people it is a religious sin to wear it, destroying in the fire the noble handiwork of one’s fellow-men and women, one’s brothers and sisters abroad, saying it would be “defiling” to wear it, I cannot tell you how different all this appears to me.’ Gandhi defended his position. ‘If the emphasis were on all foreign things,’ he told Andrews, ‘it would be racial, parochial and wicked. The emphasis is on all foreign cloth. The restriction makes all the difference in the world.’ Gandhi did not want to shut out such exquisite handcrafted items as European watches or Japanese lacquerwork. But ‘love of foreign cloth has brought foreign domination, pauperism and what is worst, shame to many a home’. Gandhi believed that importing foreign cloth had not only put many weavers out of work, but forced the women in their families into prostitution.25 Joining Andrews in his disenchantment with Gandhi’s methods was their mutual friend Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore was travelling in North America in 1921, raising funds for his university, when a recent article by Gandhi was brought to his attention. Entitled ‘Evil Wrought by the English Medium’, it claimed that ‘Rammohun Roy would have been a greater reformer, and Lokmanya Tilak would have been a greater scholar, if they had not to start with the handicap of having to think in English and transmit their thoughts chiefly in English’. Gandhi argued that ‘of all the superstitions that affect India, none is so great as that a knowledge of the English language is necessary for imbibing ideas of liberty, and developing accuracy of thought’. As a result of the system of education introduced by the English, ‘the tendency has been to dwarf the Indian body, mind and soul’. 26 Tagore was dismayed by the article, and wrote to C.F. Andrews that ‘I strongly protest against Mahatma Gandhi’s trying to cut down such great personalities of Modern India as Rammohan Roy in his blind zeal for crying down our modern education’. These criticisms, added Tagore tellingly, showed that Gandhi ‘is growing enamoured of his own doctrines—a dangerous form of egotism, that even great people suffer from at times’.  The Mahatma believed that the nineteenth-century reformer Rammohan Roy was limited by his familiarity with English. To the contrary, Tagore argued that through his engagement with other languages, Roy ‘could be perfectly natural in his acceptance of the West, not only because his education had been perfectly Eastern,—he had the full inheritance of the Indian wisdom. He was never a school boy of the West, and therefore he had the dignity to be the friend of the West.’27 Andrews shared the letter with the press. The criticisms stung Gandhi, who immediately published a clarification in his journal, Young India. He pointed to his own friendship with white men (Andrews among them), and the hospitality granted to Englishmen by many non-cooperators. Neither he nor his flock were guilty of chauvinism or xenophobia. His defence was then summed up in these words: ‘I hope I am as great a believer in free air as the great Poet. I do not want my house to be walled in on all sides and my windows to be stuffed. I want the cultures of all the lands to be blown about my house as freely as possible. But I refuse to be blown off my feet by any.’28 In July 1921, Tagore returned home from his travels. To his dismay, many members of the staff at Santiniketan had enthusiastically embraced the non-cooperation movement, thus giving themselves up to ‘narrow nationalist ideas that were already out of date’.  In the first week of September, Gandhi met Tagore at his family home in Calcutta. They had a long and argumentative conversation. Tagore told Gandhi that ‘the whole world is suffering today from the cult of a selfish and short-sighted nationalism. India has all down her history offered hospitality to the invader of whatever nation, creed or colour. I have come to believe that, as Indians, we not only have much to learn from the West but that we also have something to contribute. We dare not therefore shut the West out.’29 Gandhi’s answer is not recorded. But apparently, Tagore was not satisfied, since he chose to make his criticisms public in the influential Calcutta journal Modern Review. In his recent travels in the West, said Tagore, he had met many people who sought ‘to achieve the unity of man, by destroying the bondage of nationalism’. Then he returned home, to be confronted with a political movement suffused with negativity. Are ‘we alone to be content with telling the beads of negation’, asked Tagore,  ‘harping on other’s faults and proceeding with the erection of Swaraj on a foundation of quarrelsomeness’? 30 Gandhi responded immediately, defending the non-cooperation movement as ‘a refusal to cooperate with the English administrators on their own terms’. Indian nationalism, he insisted, ‘is not exclusive, nor aggressive, nor destructive. It is health-giving, religious and therefore humanitarian.  India must learn to live before she can aspire to die for humanity. The mice which helplessly find themselves between the cat’s teeth acquire no merit from their enforced sacrifice.’31 Tagore’s own elder brother was on Gandhi’s side in this debate. Himself a poet and composer of distinction, Dwijendranath Tagore was a much-loved figure in Bengal, universally known as ‘Bordada’ (elder brother). In September 1920, he had sent Young India an article on the ‘inner meaning’ of non-cooperation. This argued that ‘in this extreme crisis of our country, it is incumbent upon the wisest in the land to stand apart from the blood-sucking influence of the authorities, and with their own exertions and in their own ways to give a full expression to their own ideal’. 32 A year later, when his brother was publicly rebuking the Mahatma, Dwijendranath sent Gandhi a short but telling private note: Dearest and most revered Mahatma,  Robi[ndranath] is taking a wrong course. He is creating an atmosphere of mirth & music around him while India is travailing to give birth to her new child ‘Swaraj’.  He is unnecessarily pouring water on the widespread branches of Universal brotherhood leaving its root to wither for want of water. Poor kindhearted Mr Andrews is in danger of being perverted from his course.  To tell you the truth I am sick at heart. You are my only pole star of hope. May God shower blessing on your head day and night.  Your unworthy Bordada Dwijendranath Tagore33 Another celebrated Bengali who favoured Gandhi over Tagore was the scientist-entrepreneur Prafulla Chandra Ray. Ray called Gandhi ‘a veritable miracle worker—the saviour of modern and builder of future India’. Then he added: ‘There are occasions when silence is golden and speech is but silver. I think Rabindranath would have best consulted the interests of the country if he had followed this precept.’34 Dwijendranath Tagore was a full twenty years older than his brother. At the age of eighty, he surely hoped to see swaraj come before he was gone. P.C. Ray had faced much opposition from British entrepreneurs and British officials in starting his own factories. That the two supported Gandhi so wholeheartedly was proof of their nationalism, and of the Mahatma’s own power to move and to inspire. Their consent, however, perhaps makes Tagore’s dissent all the more noteworthy.  A hundred years on, the Tagore–Gandhi debate still makes for compelling reading. The Mahatma insisted that a colonized nation had first to discover itself before discovering the world. The poet answered that there was a thin line between nationalism and xenophobia—besides, hatred of the foreigner could easily turn into a hatred of Indians of other castes, classes or communities. He was particularly sceptical of the claim that non-cooperation had or would dissolve Hindu–Muslim differences.  VII In a bid to curb the non-cooperation movement, the government sought to control the press. The first step was to disallow nationalist periodicals from carrying government advertisements. A list of ‘newspapers unsuitable to receive official advertisements and for perusal by Indian troops’ was prepared. More than 300 periodicals were included in this list, including Gandhi’s own Young India and Navajivan, the Bombay Chronicle, as well as journals in Urdu, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Bengali and other Indian languages. 35 Despite the ban, these newspapers survived. And the nationalist message was conveyed as much by word of mouth as through print. So the government decided to arrest the non-cooperators. From July 1921, thousands of protesters were booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. These included Section 121 (waging, or attempting to wage war, or abetting waging of war, against the Government of India), Section 124 (assaulting government officials or otherwise seeking to restrain the exercise of any lawful power), Section 124A (the preaching or practice of sedition), Section 131 (abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from his duty), Section 150 (hiring, or conniving at hiring, of persons to join an unlawful assembly), Section 151 (knowingly joining or continuing in an assembly of five or more persons after it had been commanded to disperse), Sections 153 and 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc.), and Section 447 (criminal trespass).  In late August, seeking to spread the message of swadeshi and non-cooperation, Gandhi visited Assam for the first time, and then went from there by train to Chittagong and eastern Bengal. With him was Mohammad Ali. They spoke together at many public meetings, some held in parks, others in mosques.  The eastern tour ended in Calcutta in the second week of September. Here, shops that still stocked goods from abroad were picketed daily by energetic nationalists led by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad.  Gandhi, with Azad next to him, participated in several bonfires of foreign cloth.  While he was in Calcutta, Gandhi got a letter from Shaukat Ali saying he had heard from friends that he and his brother would soon he arrested. On 21 October, the Central Khilafat Committee planned to meet in Delhi. ‘I doubt we will be allowed to attend . . .’ wrote Shaukat. Yet he was ‘sure our arrest would advance our sacred cause and we have no fear for the future’. Sending ‘his love and devoted affection’, the elder of the Ali Brothers placed his total trust in his Hindu friend. ‘You need no certificate from any of us,’ he remarked, ‘but I must press my honest conviction that there could be no more considerate, insightful and patient chief to lead us than you whom India loves and respects.’36 From Calcutta, Gandhi and Mohammad Ali took a train down the Coromandel coast. On 14 September, they halted at Waltair for a public meeting. Here (as they had anticipated), Mohammad Ali was arrested and taken away by the police. Shaukat Ali, then in North India, was arrested shortly afterwards.  While incarcerating the Ali Brothers, the government stayed their hand as regards Gandhi. In this they were following the advice of the Allahabad Moderate Tej Bahadur Sapru, then law member of the viceroy’s executive council. Sapru argued that the arrest could wait till ‘Mr. Gandhi by some overt act will place himself so much in the wrong that we should be doing the right thing in prosecuting him, or we may reach a stage when a considerable body of opinion will have detached itself from Mr. Gandhi and the situation will then have become easier’.37 After his companion was detained, Gandhi addressed a meeting in Waltair, before carrying on to Madras and further south. In the town of Madurai he took a decision to simplify his dress even further.  He would now discard the shirt, and wear a loincloth only.  The idea had been in Gandhi’s mind for some time. He first thought of it in Barisal in Bengal. He finally took the step only in Madurai, when people told him that they had not enough khadi or where khadi was available, not enough money. When he communicated his decision to his co-workers, Maulana Azad understood immediately, but the others, including C. Rajagopalachari, were unhappy.  ‘They felt such radical change might make people uneasy, some might not understand it; some might take me to be a lunatic . . .’ Typically, the opposition made Gandhi even more resolute in his decision. 38 VIII Gandhi had hoped to go on to Malabar, the Malayalam-speaking district of the Madras Presidency. He was stopped from doing so, because a major rebellion had broken out in the district, and martial law had been declared. In the agrarian system of Malabar, the tenants were predominantly Muslim (belonging to a community known as the Moplahs), and the landlords largely Hindu. The Moplahs were a militant lot, who had rebelled several times in the nineteenth century. The present uprising was partly a class war of tenants versus landlords, and partly a religious war, of Muslims versus Hindus.  From September 1921, armed bands of Moplahs began attacking the homes of landlords, torching government offices and police stations, tearing up railway tracks and telegraph lines, and, occasionally, abducting women. Hindus captured by the rebels were offered the choice of Islam or death.  The ranks of the rebels were populated by coolies, cultivators, keepers of tea shops, petty merchants, Koran readers and mosque attendants. At its height, there were nearly 10,000 armed Moplahs on the move. Two brigades of infantry and 700 special police were needed to suppress the rebellion. More than 2000 Moplahs were killed in the exchanges, as well as some fifty soldiers and policemen.39 The Moplah rebellion raised a large question mark over the future of Gandhi’s movement. The uprising was not non-violent, and it had ruptured rather than furthered Hindu–Muslim unity. As the district magistrate of Malabar noted, among the rebels ‘the talk of Hindu–Muslim unity was nonsense and the main idea was the vision of swaraj and Malabar for the Mapilla and the Mapilla alone’. 40 Gandhi accepted that the Moplah rebellion was a setback to his struggle. But he did not despair,  ‘for the simple reason that no sane Muslim approves of what a few Moplahs have done’. Later, at a public meeting on the Marina beach, Gandhi said the Moplahs ‘have committed a sin against the Khilafat and against their own country’. Yet he hoped ‘that my Hindu countrymen will keep their senses’, since he did ‘not know a single sensible Mussulman who approves either secretly or openly of these forcible conversions . . .’41 In an article for Navajivan, Gandhi admitted that his recent tour of Madras ‘was something of a disappointment’. The province lagged behind in the production of khadi, the ‘untouchables’ suffered ‘more indignities than they do in almost any other part of the country’, and the Moplah rebellion had undermined his cherished dream of Hindu–Muslim unity. Gandhi was consoled by his growing friendship with C. Rajagopalachari, who accompanied him for much of his tour. Praising Rajaji’s ‘wisdom, integrity and ability’, Gandhi noted that his Tamil colleague had ‘fully understood the meaning of our struggle and, in a moment of crisis, he can be resolute and patient’.42 IX Gandhi spent October shuttling between Ahmedabad and Bombay, attending to his ashram in the one place and pursuing the non-cooperation agenda in the other. He had taken a vow to spin half an hour every day before lunch, and forgo the meal if he failed to do so. The vow was not binding when he was on a train. 43 For most of 1921, Mahadev Desai was away in Allahabad, where he was assisting Motilal Nehru in running a new nationalist paper called The Independent. In his absence, a new recruit named Pyarelal was acting as Gandhi’s secretary. From the Punjab, he had freshly graduated with a degree in English literature. One of Pyarelal’s assets was an excellent memory; he had made it his business to learn entire passages from Gandhi’s writings and speeches.  The Prince of Wales was due to tour India that winter. Gandhi asked the public to boycott the visit, since it was a ‘crime’ to bring the prince over ‘for personal pleasure and sport when India is seething with discontent’. The ship carrying the prince landed in Bombay on 17 November; on Gandhi’s instructions, at the very hour the heir to the English throne was disembarking, a massive bonfire of foreign cloth was lit in central Bombay.44 While Gandhi called for a boycott, Indians loyal to the Raj enthusiastically welcomed the visitor.  This led to clashes in the streets, between the non-cooperators burning cloth and the Empire loyalists chanting slogans in praise of the prince. The conflict revealed and built upon cleavages of religion, class and political affiliation. Parsis and Christians (identified by their headgear or clothing) were singled out for attack by Hindus and Muslims, presumably because they were seen as pro-British (and were also relatively prosperous). Millworkers were prominent among the rioters, who from time to time raised the cry of ‘Mahatma Gandhi ki jai’.  Gandhi was appalled by the violence. The day after the riot, he composed a long essay for Young India. He heard of the trouble at 1 p.m., and at once motored to the Two Tanks area, where he found a liquor shop smashed, two policemen badly wounded and lying unconscious on cots without anybody caring for them. I alighted. Immediately the crowd surrounded me and yelled Mahatma Gandhi ki jai. That sound usually grates on my ears, but it has grated never so much as it did yesterday when the crowd unmindful of the two sick brethren choked me with the shout at the top of their voices. I rebuked them and they were silent. Water was brought for the two wounded men. I requested two of my companions and some from the crowd to take the dying policemen to the hospital. I proceeded then to the scene a little further up where I saw a fire rising. They were two tram-cars which were burnt by the crowd. On returning I witnessed a burning motor car.  I appealed to the crowd to disperse, told them that they had damaged the cause of the Khilafat, the Punjab and swaraj. I returned sick at heart and in a chastened mood.  After the events in Bombay, wrote Gandhi, ‘the hope of reviving mass civil disobedience has once more in my opinion been dashed to pieces. . . . If I can have nothing to do with the organized violence of the Government, I can have less to do with the unorganized violence of the people.’ Gandhi went on a fast from 19 November, breaking it four days later when the violence had subsided. As he wrote in Young India, ‘for me fast was a necessity. I was the guilty party. I was the bankrupt.’45 The violence in Bombay provoked a series of sombre articles by Gandhi in Young India. Non-cooperators, he said, must now ‘retrace our steps and scrupulously insure minorities against the least molestation’. For, if they could not tolerate Parsis and Christians, what was the guarantee that ‘Hindus . . . would not impose their will upon the Mussulman minority, or the Mussulmans, if they believed themselves to be capable of wielding superior brute strength, would not crush the weak Hindu in spite of his numerical superiority? ’46 X From November 1921, the government renewed its crackdown on the non-cooperators. Arrests were made of people picketing liquor shops, holding meetings, selling prohibited literature, etc. By the middle of December, 1500 protesters had been arrested in Bengal alone, and several hundred apiece in Madras, UP, Bombay and Sindh. Among those in jail was Harilal Gandhi, arrested in Calcutta.  The police now began to target the senior leadership. In early December, C.R. Das, president-elect of the Congress to be held in Ahmedabad later that month, was arrested in Calcutta. A group of women, who included C.R. Das’s wife and sister, were also detained for selling khadi on the road (they were charged with blocking traffic, and thus became the first women arrested in the movement).  On 6 December, Abul Kalam Azad wrote to Gandhi that ‘the repression in Calcutta is much more severe than what we heard while at Bombay. The Government is determined to strike at the very root and crush the movement.’ Azad himself was planning ‘to organise a successful “HARTAL” on the 24th and to maintain Peace and Order which the Government wishes otherwise’.47 A week in advance of the hartal he hoped to organize, Azad was taken into custody by the police. J.B. Kripalani was arrested in Banaras; Motilal Nehru and Mahadev Desai in Allahabad; and C. Rajagopalachari in Madras.  Many Congress leaders were now in jail. It was now more than twelve months since Gandhi had promised ‘swaraj in one year’. Despite the struggle and the sacrifice, political freedom seemed as distant as ever. Gandhi wrote that he was ‘being implored, on the one hand, not to carry out my threat to retire to the Himalayas if we do not get swaraj by the end of this year. On the other hand, I am asked what face I shall show to the people if we fail to get swaraj.’ Gandhi now provided himself with an escape route, writing that ‘swaraj means self-reliance. To hope that I shall get swaraj for them is the opposite of self-reliance.’ The Hindu/Muslim vs Parsi/Christian riots had ‘put an obstacle in our path. We ourselves had planned to start a fight and invite suffering upon ourselves; Bombay made this impossible.’48 The next Congress was to be held in Ahmedabad in December 1921. On the eve of the Congress, Gandhi reminded the readers of Young India of the four key elements of the nationalist credo: unity between Hindus and Muslims and all other faiths; manufacture and use of handmade cloth; abolition of untouchability; and a strict adherence to non-violence. ‘These are like the four posts of a bedstead,’ he wrote. ‘Remove one of them and it cannot stand.’49 Some 4700 delegates attended the Congress, coming from all the provinces of British India. There were vigorous debates, the most important of which was between the prominent cleric Maulana Hasrat Mohani and Gandhi. Mohani claimed that the Muslims had contributed disproportionately to the struggle—according to one (probably embroidered) report, he said that while Hindus outnumbered Muslims four to one among the general population, 95 per cent of those who went to jail were Muslim. Gandhi disputed these figures, saying the Hindus had courted arrest in large numbers too.50 Maulana Mohani asked for the removal, in the Congress’s main resolution, of all clauses making non-violence mandatory. He also wanted a complete severance of the British connection. Gandhi, speaking for the resolution (which eventually passed with a large majority), said that while within the Congress there could be differences on whether swaraj should come within the British Empire or outside it, ‘there could be no room for those who wanted to resort to violence’.  In his home town, Gandhi was in command. As a news report on the Congress commented, when he reached ‘the rostrum in his usual loin-cloth, there was an enthusiastically devotional and deafening applause’.51 XI A year had come and gone, and the swaraj that Gandhi had promised in this time was as distant as ever. So he now began preparing for a fresh round of civil disobedience. This would begin in the taluks of Bardoli and Anand, in his native Gujarat, and where his lieutenant of peasant background, Vallabhbhai Patel, had great influence. Peasants were to be asked to stop paying taxes and refuse all cooperation with the government. Gandhi hoped that if the experiment in Gujarat succeeded, it could be replicated elsewhere in India. 52 The Bombay government was now very keen to arrest Gandhi. The governor wrote to the viceroy that since Gandhi was preparing to ‘completely throw off [his] disguise’ and launch ‘a general attack on Government’, it was dangerous to wait any longer. He submitted a list of articles written by Gandhi in Young India which clearly counted as ‘seditious’. The viceroy consulted his senior officials, who counselled caution. Action against Gandhi would alienate even the Moderates. As the home secretary of the Government of India put it,  In the fight for position the tactical advantage has already to a very undesirable extent passed to Gandhi and his arrest and prosecution at the present juncture would seriously increase that advantage . . . [T]he arrest of Gandhi at the present moment so far from lessening our difficulties, would add to them considerably. 53 On 26 January Gandhi left his ashram at Ahmedabad, telling the inmates that he was going to Bardoli for the preparation of civil disobedience and the non-payment of taxes. He added: ‘I shall be back here in a week, maybe a month, or a year, or perhaps I may not return here at all.’54 Gandhi was then called away to Bombay, where the Moderates, led by Jinnah, urged him to abandon his planned satyagraha in Bardoli and wait for the government to convene a round table conference. Gandhi was unpersuaded, and carried on to Bardoli, reaching there on 29 January. He toured the villages, giving speeches urging Hindu–Muslim unity and the abolition of untouchability, and asking peasants to stop paying land revenue and other government taxes. 55 On 1 February, Gandhi wrote to the viceroy, informing him that Bardoli, a taluk in the Surat district with a population of 87,000, had been made ‘the first unit for mass civil disobedience in order to mark the national revolt against the Government for its consistently criminal refusal to appreciate India’s resolve regarding the [restoration of the] Khilafat, [justice for the victims of] the Punjab [atrocities] and [the attainment of] swaraj’. Characteristically, he left a window open, ‘respectfully’ asking the viceroy to set free all political prisoners, declare ‘a policy of absolute non-interference with all non-violent activities in the country’ with regard to Khilafat, swaraj, etc., and ‘free the Press from all administrative control’. If the viceroy could make a declaration assuring this within the next week, said Gandhi, then the ‘aggressive civil disobedience’ planned for Bardoli and elsewhere would be suspended.56 On 6 February, the government issued a ‘communiqué’ in response to Gandhi’s letter. As a consequence of the non-cooperation movement, said the government, ‘the issue is no longer between this or that programme of political advance but between lawlessness with all its dangerous consequences on the one hand, and on the other, the maintenance of those principles which lie at the root of all civilized governments. Mass civil disobedience is fraught with such dangers to the State that it must be met with sternness and severity.’57 The next day Gandhi replied to the communiqué, accusing the government of ‘official lawlessness and barbarism’, through the repression of peaceful protests and the victimization of innocent individuals. The letter ended with this sharp sentence: ‘I hold that it is impossible for any body of self-respecting men, for fear of unknown dangers, to sit still and do nothing effective while looting of property and assaulting of innocent men are going on all over the country in the name of law and order.’58 Two days earlier, a police station in an obscure hamlet in the Gorakhpur district of the United Provinces had been burnt by nationalist protesters. The hamlet was named Chauri Chaura. On 4 February, a large crowd of volunteers marched through the streets, shouting slogans in praise of Gandhi and the Khilafat. They clashed with the police—sticks and stones versus bullets. The constables had the advantage of modern arms, but were massively outnumbered. When the crowd grew larger and the hail of rocks grew fiercer, they retreated into the police station. The protesters doused the building with kerosene and set it on fire. Twenty-three policemen perished in the conflagration. 59 News of the arson at Chauri Chaura took two days to travel from rural North India to rural Gujarat.  Gandhi got the news after he had sent his second letter to the viceroy on the 7th. On the next day, the 8th, he wrote to the members of the CWC. This was the third time he had ‘received a rude shock’ on the eve of embarking on mass civil disobedience. The first occasion was in April 1919, when his fellow Ahmedabadis rioted after he had been stopped from entering the Punjab. The second was in November 1921, the violence in Bombay ensuing from the boycott of the Prince of Wales’s visit. Now again, he had been ‘violently agitated’ by the events in Chauri Chaura. He had convened a CWC meeting at Bardoli on the 11th, to discuss whether mass civil disobedience should be suspended for the time being. 60 On 10 February—the day before the CWC met—Gandhi spoke with a group of Congress workers in Bardoli. He asked whether civil disobedience should be suspended in view of ‘the terrible happening at Chauri Chaura’. All but three said the movement should go on, for after Gandhi’s challenge to the viceroy if he (and they) now retreated, ‘the whole country would be disgraced before the world’. Gandhi was dismayed by the response, which showed that even the ‘best workers’ of the Congress had ‘failed to understand the message of non-violence’. He was now resolved to ‘immediately stop the movement for civil disobedience’.61 The CWC, meeting the next day, passed a series of resolutions drafted by Gandhi. In view of ‘the tragic and terrible events at Chauri Chaura’, the Congress had decided to suspend civil disobedience, advise cultivators to pay land revenue, and not hold processions or public meetings. The working committee outlined a new programme for the Congress, focusing on the promotion of spinning and of temperance, the abolition of untouchability, and the organization of village and town panchayats to settle disputes peaceably. 62 To atone for the violence at Chauri Chaura, Gandhi went on a five-day fast. ‘Surely I could not have done less, could I?’ he wrote to his son Devadas. For, ‘to start civil disobedience in an atmosphere of incivility is like putting one’s hand in a snake-pit’. 63 Gandhi’s decision to call off the struggle divided the Congress leadership. While older Congressmen such as M.A. Ansari supported him, younger radicals like Jawaharlal Nehru were ‘terribly cut up’.64 Why should the leader allow one isolated episode to derail a vigorous mass upsurge that had otherwise eschewed violence? Tens of thousands had already courted arrest. Tens of thousands more were ready to follow them. The whole country was afire with the spirit of swaraj.  The British Raj was nervous—as its policies of repression showed. Why, when energy and enthusiasm ran so high, did the leader abandon the movement?  Gandhi was unmoved. He had been told that the policemen at Chauri Chaura had ‘given much provocation’. But ‘no provocation can possibly justify the brutal murder of men who had been rendered defenceless and who had virtually thrown themselves on the mercy of the mob’. After what had happened in Chauri Chaura, Gandhi ‘would think 50 times before embarking upon mass civil disobedience’. 65 XII By early February 1922, the viceroy could hold out no longer. On the 8th of the month, he passed an order asking ‘that action should be taken at once for the immediate arrest and prosecution of Gandhi’.  But before the order could be acted upon, the CWC had called off civil disobedience. The home secretary now advised the viceroy to stay the arrest. On 15 February, Lord Reading issued a fresh order asking that ‘the prosecution of Gandhi be postponed for the moment’. Ten days later, the AICC met in Delhi and endorsed the CWC’s resolutions in Bardoli, adding a caveat that civil disobedience had been postponed temporarily, not indefinitely. This persuaded the government that there had been ‘no fundamental change in the policy of the non-co-operation party’. Fresh orders were now issued for Gandhi’s arrest.66 The Bombay government had decided to arrest Gandhi on 9 March. The previous day, Gandhi left Ahmedabad for a meeting of nationalist ulemas in Ajmer. The authorities waited until he had returned.  On the evening of 10 March, the deputy superintendent of police (DSP) of Ahmedabad drove in his car to the Sabarmati Ashram. On his way he saw Shankarlal Banker and Anasuya Sarabhai out on a postprandial walk. The DSP told Banker he had a warrant for his arrest and for Gandhi’s.  Banker’s crime was that he was the publisher of Young India, and thus complicit in Gandhi’s ‘seditious’ articles. The DSP reported that on hearing the news, Banker ‘seemed very pleased and said he was expecting it’. Anasuya was told to ask Gandhi to get his things ready. When the police officer arrived, Gandhi congratulated him on coming without an escort. He asked the ashramites to sing his favourite Narasinha Mehta hymn, ‘ Vaishnava Jana To’. His parting words were that they should ‘strain every nerve to propagate peace and goodwill all over India, among all communities’. 67 The DSP took Gandhi, Kasturba, Shankarlal and Anasuya to the jail in his car. He woke up the prison superintendent (it was now past 11 p.m.), and handed over the two men to him, before dropping the two ladies back at the ashram. He then went to the Navajivan Press to obtain documentary proof of Gandhi’s and Shankarlal’s connection with Young India. 68 The ashram at Sabarmati had been chosen in part because of its proximity to the Sabarmati jail.  Gandhi and Shankarlal were lodged in a section of the prison which had a row of eight rooms facing a courtyard. Both were allotted single rooms, each furnished with an iron cot, a mattress, two sheets, a pillow and a blanket.  The next morning the accused were presented to the court, held in the commissioner’s office.  Gandhi, asked about his profession, said he was ‘a farmer and weaver’. The magistrate was startled, pausing before noting it down, to check whether Gandhi was being serious.  Both Banker and Gandhi pleaded guilty, and the trial was set for 18 March. It was held at the Circuit House, and many leading Congressmen attended, sometimes travelling long distances. They included Jawaharlal Nehru, Sarojini Naidu and Madan Mohan Malaviya. Saraladevi Chaudhurani was also there, having come all the way from Lahore. She sat two seats away from Kasturba—the sources do not tell us whether they exchanged any words.  After Gandhi and Banker had pleaded guilty, the advocate general, Sir J.T. Strangman, made his presentation. The articles published by Gandhi in Young India, he said, were part of an ‘organized campaign . . . to preach disaffection towards the existing Government’. Since the accused ‘was a man of high educational qualifications’ and ‘a recognised leader’, the ‘harm that was likely to be caused was considerable’. As for the second accused, Shankarlal Banker, ‘his offence was lesser. He did the publication and he did not write.’ Gandhi then read out a statement he had prepared. He spoke of his work in South Africa, his belief that the treatment of Indians there was an aberration and that British rule was ‘intrinsically and mainly good’. He mentioned his work raising ambulance corps in 1899, 1906 and 1914, these ‘actuated by the belief that it was possible by such services to gain a status of full equality in the Empire for my countrymen’.  The ‘first shock’ to Gandhi’s faith in the British Empire was the Rowlatt Act, ‘a law designed to rob the people of all freedom’. Then ‘followed the Punjab horrors’, and finally, the going back on the promise regarding the Khilafat. His ‘hope shattered’, Gandhi ‘came reluctantly to the conclusion that the British connection had made India more helpless than she ever was before, politically and economically’. Hence the movement which he had started, based on the belief that ‘non-co-operation with evil is as much a duty as is co-operation with the good’.  It was time now for the judge, C.N. Broomfield, to deliver his judgment. The son of a London barrister, he had spent almost two decades in the Indian Civil Service. After saying that Gandhi had made it easy for him by pleading guilty, Broomfield remarked that it was impossible to ignore the fact that you are in a different category from any person I have ever tried or am likely to have to try. It would be impossible to ignore the fact that in the eyes of millions of your countrymen, you are a great patriot and a great leader.  Even those who differ from you in politics look upon you as a man of high ideals and of noble and even saintly life.  The law, however, was ‘no respector of persons’. Gandhi had by his own admission broken the law.  The judge had agonized as to what would be a just sentence, and—addressing the accused directly— said he had finally decided on a jail term of six years, which he hoped Gandhi would not consider ‘unreasonable’, since Bal Gangadhar Tilak had once got the same sentence under the same section of the law. Then, in what must surely be among the most unusual wishes offered by a judge anywhere at any time, Justice Broomfield remarked that ‘if the course of events in India should make it possible for the Government to reduce the period and release you, no one will be better pleased than I’.  Since Shankarlal Banker’s offence was less serious, he was sentenced to a year and a half in jail.69 When I first read Judge Broomfield’s words some three decades ago, I was moved almost to tears.  In rereading them now, my response is only slightly less emotional. The judge himself saw the matter in more detached terms. In his diary for 18 March, he had pencilled the following entries: Golf before breakfast Try Gandhi70 In the evening, the judgment delivered, Broomfield most likely went for a drink in the club. A day later, the men he had sentenced were taken in a special train bound for Poona, where they would be lodged in the Yerwada Jail.
